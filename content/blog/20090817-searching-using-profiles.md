In order to fully leverage their technology, web service providors want your information, so they can present you with relevant information from the www.  The problem here is that you would not have control of that data - there may be many times when you dont want your browsing information recorded, for many reasons!-->

# Searching using profiles

![apmldiagram](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/apmldiagram-134x150.png)User profiling is about empowering the web user - the user should always control the data they want to be available to web services (search engines the largest example).   In order to fully leverage their technology, web service providors want your information, so they can present you with relevant information from the www.  The problem here is that you would not have control of that data - there may be many times when you dont want your browsing information recorded, for many reasons! ![apmlresults](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/apmlresults-150x101.png)Using profiling options such a an APML file, can give you control using the power of microformats (the best way to present data across the www, as they are data storage standards supported by many web services).  For example, you will notice an additional search box to bottom of page, and that is where a user can enter in their APML profile URL.  This site then uses that [APML ](http://groups.google.com/group/apml-public/web/apml-faq) interests file to guage relevant posts, and even reports **%** relevance (click on thumbnail to right to view screenshot).   Try it youself with [our APML profile URL](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/) _._ Now doesnt that seem like an easier way to search for information, and find out quickly is a site is for you?  A basic demonstration of the possibilities towards semantic web - our APML profile is generated based on the blog post tags, and their frequency.    It is worth remembering that computer systems are only as intelligent as the humans that "tells" them what to do - that is going to include you now!
