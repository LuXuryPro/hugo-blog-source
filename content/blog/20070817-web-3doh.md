# web 3.doh

Finding all-encompassing definitions for web 2.0 was difficult enough, and now we have web 3.0, which I found was neatly summarised in an article by Sramana Mitra [http://sramanamitra.com/2007/02/14/web-30-4c-p-vs/] Web 2.0 focussed on building communities and user-generated content, in attempt to build conhesion on the web in organic fashion.Â Web 3.0 has more clarity, with less dependency on the user, and more dependency on the technologies to enable the user to contribute, and most importantly for the user to gain from that contribution.Â For semantic web, read intelligent web!
