# Track and follow your position with openlayers

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/openlayers-125x125.png)Track and follow your position with openlayers - a less saturated alternative maps api to googlemaps, and gowing steadily in popularity and support. Click the Track button to find your current location, and it will update as you move as with any other map tracking application. Probably best viewed on you phone I guess!
