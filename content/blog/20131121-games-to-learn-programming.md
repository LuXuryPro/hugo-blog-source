# Games to learn programming

> Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen. http://robocode.sourceforge.net/

> RoboWar is a freeware strategy game. Yes it is free. The goal of the game is to make your robot kill all other robots and be the alone survivor. To do this you must program a robot in RoboWar's own language which is easy to learn. http://robowar.sourceforge.net/RoboWar5/index.html

> Core Wars is a programming game in which two or more programs run in a simulated computer with the goal of terminating every other program and surviving as long as possible. http://www.corewars.org/

> Bug Brain is a game where you build brains to run a bug. You start in the lab where you experiment with the neurons and nodes that make up a brain. From there you move out into the field to build a brain for a Lady Bug to help it feed and survive. Bug Brain features rendered graphics, challenging puzzles and the opportunity to learn about neural networks. http://www.biologic.com.au/bugbrain/
