# Global Facebook Activity Visualization

The goal of Facebook's Project Palantir is to "visualize all the data that Facebook gets". Each Facebook action is geo-located on a 3D globe, becomes a particle that floats off the surface of the Earth, and then disappears. Facebook interactions (e.g. friend requests, pokes, wall posts) are shown by 3D splines or a trailing mesh connecting 2 locations, with each color representing a different sort of interaction.
