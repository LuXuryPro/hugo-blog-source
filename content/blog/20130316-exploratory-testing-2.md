# Exploratory testing my patience

Exploratory testing has been in the middle of what I call a "no, no, listen to me" circus. People saying virtually the same things, then dissecting the semantics to death. Exploratory testing is what differentiate a tester, from someone simply following script guidance.  A tester should have the skills to look beyond the formal testing scope, and realise there can be many paths to same destination, all with potential obstacles. To approach testing in a blinkered way, sticking to strict requirements sign-off  Just as developers can "massage" a coding task to get it done quicker, though no necessarily fulfilling the clients visions, testers can also be guilty of same behaviour, with test scope and scripts. Exploratory testing should always be relevant, of course, and it should be. Exploratory testing occurs as result of test analysis or simply experience while testing. Finding anomalies and oddities to part of a testers job, it's adds value to the project because it means someone is anticipating problems, rather than following a strictly stable path.  Clients and Product Owners can never be granular enough to cover every scenario.  A combination of developer logic, and tester investigation, can uncover other scenarios, and problems not foreseen when requirements were first decided on. The confusion has been caused largely by various consultancies trying to promote an Exploratory testing service, at the same time as learning it as they go. Sometimes changing their minds week by week, on what it actually means. The clumsy attempts of various people describing what Exploratory is about, belies the underlying culture that Agile spawned - that of the self-appointed expert. Now, anyone with over 10 years history in testing knows for sure that Exploratory has always been done. OK, not in a formalised approach all to itself, but wrapped up in general day-to-day testing. There are 3 key concerns that make Exploratory testing so important, especially on project using modern rapid development approaches. 

  * I can't assume the client has envisaged all the requirements they actually want.
  * I can't assume the Product Owner has envisaged the impact of new or changed requirements.
  * I can't assume the Product Owner has envisaged has fully realised the impact of new code.
