# Screen reader emulator

[Screen Reader Emulator Developer](http://www.standards-schmandards.com/projects/fangs/) is a Firefox addon that does a decent job of rendering webpage, as a screen reader would see it. Accessibility is yet to be enforced in this country, though it strange that it takes law for business to increase their audience. I do not beleive that usiness world has any idea how many more customers or visitors their website could have, if they improved their web accessibility policy. ALL websites should be attaining Level A by default, and there are anough tools out to help. Use in conjunction with [WAVE toolbar](http://wave.webaim.org), and you will be well on your way to confirming to [WCAG Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). Once installed, just right-click on a wb page and select "View Fangs". Along with the screen reader output, you will get extracted lists of Headings and Links.
