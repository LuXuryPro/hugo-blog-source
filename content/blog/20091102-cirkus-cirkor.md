# Cirkus Cirkor

I dont go out to theatre as much as I used to, but this was very worth breaking that bad habit.  A fabulous, and different circus troupe called Cirkus Cirkor.  A great combination of the sinister, the funny, the acrobatic and a great performance!  The costumes and makeup added to the atmosphere, which was maintained throughout both halves of the perofrmance.  Thoroughly recommend this very inventive troupe.
