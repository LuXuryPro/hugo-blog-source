# Lab Pixies

![labpixies](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/labpixies_pixies.gif) A nifty site provide gadgets (or widgets for more familiar terminology) which you can integrate into variety of socila networkinng sites such as Typepad and MySpace. There are games, tools and a new addition - moodgets, where you can generate widget to display your mood to your friends. I am into socila networking as a professional still, rather than social networking. The main reason I like this site is for the nifty games I can put on a private page and play occasionally.
