# Permanent work - live life like a 5 year old

![](http://peoplesgeography.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/wellington-grey-this-modern-life.png?w=344&h=149)If you work in IT, do you do one job or many?  Or more the point, do you think you could do.  Most permanent workers in IT are either seriously under-worked (the majority) or hideously overworked (the talented minority).  I have never had the experience of permanent role in IT, so cannot comment of the differences between the two.  I do know for a fact that contractors/consultants are generally far more productive, as there is service element in both expectation and delivery.

What got me on this was when I added another website project to my linkedin account.  This spawned a number of automated emails from agencies, congratulating me on my new role, and to please consider them when I am next looking.  Rather irritating, but I am over 40 now, so easily done :)  The UK are lagging behind as usual on fundamentals, when most of the things we seem to celebrate these days in terms of progress are shallow (this will deserve a whole separate post!).  Permanent work has had its days, and even the younger generation are clinging to this outdated concept.  It is down to a childlike mentality that your employed should provide everything for you, down to wiping your ass.  How about doing a job well - or is that out of scope for workers rights these days?

Should I employ 2/3 people when all I need is a competent 1?

Of course not.
