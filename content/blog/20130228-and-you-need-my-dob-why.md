# And you need my DOB, why?

The tedious repetitive nightmare of constantly adding the same profile details to every poxy web service that comes along.  Yet another skills site, another reviews site - all expecting you to contribute to their sites.  I was about to sign up for a facebook app, from a website that was for people advertising their skills.  Then I thought, well what is linkedin for?  These kind of sites are incredibly easy to set up, and if promoted smartly, can gain significant number of signups very quickly.  Enough to get more funding I guess. But then what? The problem with web 2.o and the problem that remains today, is the onus is on us to manage ourselves, and to follow the web service ethos.  Which is "we can't survive without your data".  But there general approach is sloppy and derivative.  You cannot have these type of services, without a lot more programming intelligence running at central control.  Or people.  Yes, anyone can set up an account, add their skills - but are they prepared to market themselves, actively update the website?  And will they even be prepared to take jobs, when available?  I think that covers a good proportion of the impressive subscriber numbers.  Very misleading. They mitigate these "lazy" subscribers, by bombarding with emails, with sickening cheery intros such as "you may have more friends than you think!", or "someone who needs your skills signed up in your area".  Misleading "bothering" - and the cheery tone only serves to annoy more.  There is a reason there are far less managers, than non-managers - a lot of people need coersion, beyond the excitement of the signup and mayeb some profile building.  More than likely, the majority of signups will stagnate quickly.  If you are going to invest time building an online profile you might as well build your own website and/or use something like linkedin.  There is too much risk of wasting your time, for very limited benefit potential. I fully expect to see a ramp-up of derivative sites this sites, before the majority get sucked down a deep hole.  So be careful who what sites you bother to put efforts into.  Or even better, promote yourself with your own websites - then use the social and professional networks to promote the website. ![web 20 manager](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/web20manager1.png)
