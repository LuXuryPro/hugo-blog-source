# Hosting companies to avoid #1: AQHost

![](http://aqhost.com/images/aqlogo.gif) Stories of terrible hosting companies abound on the internet.  I was hosting my daughters blog site with them, and recently the site was shut down with no warning.  What followed was firstly attempt to use Forgotten Password on their support site - after 10 attempts and no email, I tried the live support.  The first tried to tell me that they didnt deal with that site, then pointed me to the billing site.  I informed him (politely) that I had already jumped through that hoop.  He then charmingly signed off.  I talked to another 4 operators in total, all seemingly mistified.  The last live chat helper said AQHost would send an email with details - still waiting 3 days later.  I havent mentioned the numerous online support tickets raised that werent responded to - or the fact their "helplines" were either defunct or cut out after initial intro. Thansk to AQHost my baby daughters blogsite is lost - I still have the photos of course, but what was just as precious was the words written with those photos. Avoid this terrible hosting companies, and yet another one to add to the hall of shame!
