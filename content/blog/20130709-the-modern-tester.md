# The modern tester

I choose to healthily ignore the various various debates around the place of the tester, as it hasn't changed that much. With every wave of new developers, comes along the same misplaced arrogance that they can do no wrong.  The chips have yet to leave the shoulders.  The tester has changed, just not in the way developers would like to think. In fact they should be worried. The modern tester has more cross-functional skills, the ones who will survive will anyway. And that is why I always gravitated more to testing, than the narrower field of development. That is not a slur on development, but the the developer role has long been a narrow one, in terms of expectations of what they are prepared to do. Testing is a large area, and much of it would never been touched on by a developer. We are talking here about performance, security, accessibility, coding standards. A tester is interested beyond "it works!" - how does it work, and is it working how it is supposed to. To remove the tester, is to remove testing scope.  The cartoon below was published in 2010, and now it looks like we are on brink of 1990's stage again. ![History of testing](/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/history-of-test.jpg) Good Quality Assurance would not have allowed this situation, as it adds areas of risk to quality. But the power assigned to Quality Assurance to influence, has been eroded away by fools who believe pipe dreams, over evidence. Quality Assurance is a way to highlight to others about testing shortfalls, by highlighting the risk of not addressing certain areas of potential weakness. I always adopt a risk-based approach to testing strategy, because it demonstrates to the project team the ramifications of testing priorities. People can ignore a recommendation for load testing, but there could not ignore the contingency plans (and costs), if the system fails to perform when under realistic load. Then people take notice - especially those dealing with project budget concerns. Yes, I am saying the tester should also strategise - another change for the tester role, the ability to not only be part of a testing team, but be an effective one-man-band - Test Manager and Tester rolled into one pragmatic package, with the technical, planning and reporting skills associated with that. Test Automation always tend to get companies over-excited, but it is important to approach any automation project with care. A lot of testing can be at unit level, and in case of a website, many tests can be done "under the hood" using headless browser test runners. Care should be taken by the tester to build tests sensibly, and with re-use in mind. This is where the tester must sometimes push back quite hard, because expectations can quickly get unrealistic. It is important the tester is in sync with development process, or there is risk of tests becoming quickly redundant or worse, irrelevant. So testers haven't be demoted, they have actually been promoted. What the modern tester needs is a a larger technical skillset and broader view. Think less of being a tester, and more of being a testing service. The role of tester is rapidly changing, and it is up to the person whether they want to do that role.
