# Moot

There is of course no shortage of file sharing/social networking services right now.  There are other criteria to selection of these type of services, one of which is "will I ever use it?".  I will try out moot as they have a "good feel".  But mostly I am looking for **_stable services _**\- suprisingly hard - even Twitter (which I love) is starting to creak and groan on regular basis.  there seems to be a formula - the more finance a web 2.0 gets, the less it cares about the punters (albeit punters who arent paying).
