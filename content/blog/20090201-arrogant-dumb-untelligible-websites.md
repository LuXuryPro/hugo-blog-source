# Arrogant Dumb Untelligible Websites

![jaffamonkey](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/jaffamonkey-150x150.png)How are we going to move forward in web development and utlising the growing microformats standards, when developers still have memory loss when it comes to adding ALT tag information to an image.  And when it is completed it is usually not useful - what exactly does "adasddsfsdf" mean to the user, if the image cannot be displayed for any reason.  Or to any search engine that uses image ALT tag information, as part of the searching algorithm. Although there are specific microformats for various data, hcard for address book data, rss for article feeds, apml for user profiling and site ranking, most terms will be familiar to anyone who understands some basic HTML.  Not that I am comapring - microformats are about data, not formatting, but HTML has some built microformat-style tags, inlcuding the image ALT tag example above.   It is logical that if you have a persons address data, then telling the machine that is processing it, what it is actually is, it will save the machine trying to work it out from content. Part of the problem with speed of adoption is that everyone is a website expert, but few actually spend time understanding was a website, and how it is seen by the rest of the web (users AND computers).  Make your site easier to see, by defining the data within it to semantic standards.  Back it up with quality semantic XHTML and you are a website that has far more reach that you will ever see - but you will notice from your visitors statiustics, and search engine results referrals.
