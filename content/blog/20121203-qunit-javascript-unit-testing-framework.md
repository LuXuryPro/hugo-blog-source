# QUnit: JS Unit Test framework

> QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit test suite. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself! [QUnit: A JavaScript Unit Testing framework](http://qunitjs.com/)

This is used by the jQuery projects, so probably worth a look. Javascript has found new niches, with all the extensibility available now to develop effective web front-ends in a more secure and efficient manner. Javascript detractors have long predicted demise of Javascript, but that's a way off yet and perhaps now irrelevant, given the previous accusation centred around it's limitations.
