# Twitter Micro-news Agency

There are now a lot of web apps using the Twitter API - the majority are repetivie search engines, but [Microplaza](http://microplaza.com/faq) is different. MicroPlaza looks at your Twitter network and displays all the links shared by the people you follow with associated tweets. Simple, but useful for someone like me, who primarily uses Twitter netowrk for information/links. There must be a lot of Twitter users like this, if you are one, then this is recommended!
