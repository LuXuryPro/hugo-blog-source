# Crackheads & Street Charity Workers

Charity workers and crack heads are as annoying as each other. I lean more towards crackheads, as at least there is a degree of helplessness to their condition. What they share is enforced earnestness in their plights, and what they also share is inspiring a peaceful man like myself, to plunge my fist into their whining faces. Hiding behind charity banner doesn’t give anyone the right to harass people, but drug addiction strangely seems more justified reason. Maybe because over the years, street charity workers (largely brain-vacuumed backpackers looking for a fare to next poor city they will inflict themselves on) are more far the most annoying street harasser. I work in Soho and you can spot regular groups of meandering crack and smack heads wandering around behaving as if they were invisible. They are easy to spot, as at some point they will disappear into those nice posh public toilets, 2/3 at a time.   Street charity workers are even easier to spot, with large inane grins and not-so-polished prepared sales techniques, largely from era of door-to-door salesman tactics. The fact its for charity is neither here nor there - I will give to charity as and when I choose, not because some fresh-faced Nathan Barley dictates I do. The fact they are after your bank details adds insult to irritation. So my choice of street harasser is most definitely the crackhead - at very least you can have fun playing with their heads. I recommend peppering your responses to their pleas with nonsensical statements or strange ticks - my favourite at the moment is flinching every 4/5 words, and remember to proactively engage them with direct eye contact - I guarantee you they will start sweating with 20 seconds and want to get away from you.
