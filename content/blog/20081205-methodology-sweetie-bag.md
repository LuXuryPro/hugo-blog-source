# Methodology sweetie bag

![](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/agilescrumxp-150x150.jpg)Methodologies should be decided on dependant on a combination of company philosophy and project type.  We projects by default lean towards Agile method, and the attached PDF is a sample process diagram I created, to outline a release-to-test process. I took elements from Agile, SCRUM and XP to derive a process for a CMS project, a CMS that is driving over 50 website rollouts.  Adopting methodology is more about a pic 'n mix approach, rather than signing up to one wholesale.  The common misconception is that adopting a methodology will resolve all project issues.  But if you have the wrong team, the wrong management approach, or using the wrong technologies, not nmethodology will save you!  Click on link below to view PDF.
