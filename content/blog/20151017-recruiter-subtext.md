# Recruiter subtext

A few subtexts from recruiter emails - remember, good news rarely arrives by email.  It's electronic version of junk snail-mail :) 

  * "Apologies if this email is irrelevant …” : This email is irrelevant.
  * “Only 20 mins from Paddington … “ : Job is in Slough and commute is hell.
  * “I really liked your profile … “ : I’m bored and been surfing LinkedIn.
  * “… if this role is not relevant, feel free to forward to any colleagues who may be interested” : I am struggling to find anyone, please help me!
  * “Shoreditch startup needs … “ : A startup, hoping to ride on the back of it’s trendy location, want underpaid skilled professionals.
  * “It’s backed by Rhianna” : I made up this job.
  * “Long contract at blue-chip company” : I vaguely hope you will be impressed, and overlook the tedious job description.
  * “Calling all testers!” : I am a control freak.
  * “Are you Agile?” : Because the client isn’t.
  * "Large international broadcaster needs tester …” : Sky/BBC gets hiring testers wrong, yet again.
  * “Great opportunity … “ : Crap work for crap pay in unpopular location.
  * “Perm Developr Role 30k ...” : I haven’t checked your profile and I can’t spell very well.
  * “Yo!” : This is my first job.
