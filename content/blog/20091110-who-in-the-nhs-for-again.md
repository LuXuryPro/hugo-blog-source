# Who is the NHS for again?

How gratifying  - the health system I have contributed to for 20 years, and have hardly used apart from broken thumb, is expecting me to be grateful of [a guaranteed full health check every five years now I am over 40](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7968734.stm).   There was me assuming it was a right anway, but no - i have to wait until its too late to find out if theres a problem.   Then wait too long for treatment, only to end up stuck in a disgusting "exit ward" - and believe me, they are disgusting.  The NHS is largely geared towards people who cannot afford, or are unwilling to contribute to it - the rest of us might as well go private,  than relying on this limping self-serving dinosaur.   Its what they want anyway - contribute for a "public" service, but dont use it - pointless.   Already the plan is being deemed ill-concieved and ill-planned, but it is more rhetoric from government so far out of touch, its tedious.  Time for these parasites to just shut up and leave.  Anarchy is preferable to the joke of a government system at the moment.
