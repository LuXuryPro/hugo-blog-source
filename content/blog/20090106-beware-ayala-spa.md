# Beware Ayala Spa

Due to multiple intances of Xmas rip-off merchants, got a little sidetracked from usual "tekneecall" postings. Ayala Spa are one of those cruddy overpriced stalls that pop up in tube and train stations. They sell beauty products, manufactured in Israel, and claim to contain special minerals that are unique to their products. The particular stall I am referencing is in Fulham Broadway. The salesmen employed bullying tactics to sell to a friend of mine, who told me her experience. She bought me a salt scrub ("from the Holyland") for £20 (I thought the £8 pound one in Boots was overpriced!), and some nail products. The salesmen then made it difficult for her to get her £10 change, insisting he would give her something else for the money. It was only after she expressed genuine worry about spending too much money and was obviously stressed, he relented, and only sold her a £5 product. To top it all I tried the salt scrub, which is plainly just ordinary table salt, that actually started to disolve in my fingers. Now call me ignorant, but I fail to see how salt from the Dead Sea differs from salt in the North Sea. This is plainly sales bullshit for a product made in "The Holyland", i.e. Israel. Avoid these sellers - even better take advantage of their free treatment demonstration then tell them where to shove their products. They have a website - http://www.ayala-spa.com according to side of products. Try it, but for some inexplicable reason the domain does not exist. I also tried http://www.ayalaspa.com, which is a domain purchased but with no hosting. How do these sellers, with no doubt bonafide licences, manage to trade is no suprise, as this country has a very lazy incompetent civil service. I am wondering if they got the idea from the [Real Hustle](http://www.bbc.co.uk/realhustle/), where they demonstrated a scam of creating very cheap beauty products, and labelled them up in very convincing way, and sold way overpriced. Or maybe this is a more prevalent scam than I realise!
