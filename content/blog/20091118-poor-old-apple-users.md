# Poor old Apple users

![10615_ipod_touch_teardown1-237x300](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/10615_ipod_touch_teardown1-237x300-118x150.png)This is older news story from earlier this year, but I never tire of seeing how much funky Apple rip off their customers.Â  I know business is harsh, but if a corporation presents a trendy fashionable front that shields its true nature, then it winds me up like a top. http://www.cozmoslabs.com/projects/commune/?p=186
