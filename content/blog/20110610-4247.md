# Modernizr 2

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/modernizr-125x125.png)[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) is absolutely essential for cross-browser CSS, if you want to use some of the new CSS3 elements (Modernizr also covers Javacript and HTML5 cross-browser issues). Instead of relying on more flaky methods of browser detection, it works on simple principle of checking what properties the browser supports. I havent delved into the complete potential of this (it also supports cross-browser JS issues), my first experience has been very positive, after intial concern about yet another peice of javascript on the site. Most of my CSS issues were around border-radius and box-shadow support. For example:- .form_step .dropdownlist,.form_edit .dropdownlist { float:left; border:1px solid #BBB; width:314px; min-height:15px; padding:6px } .borderradius .form_step .dropdownlist,.form_edit .dropdownlist { float:left; border:1px solid #BBB; width:314px; min-height:15px; padding:6px; border-radius:6px; -moz-border-radius:6px } Simple, isn't it? there are more complex applications of this, but treading slowly so I understand it well. [Download](http://modernizr.com) and try it - you will be glad you did.
