# Quicktime is sh*t - its Apple, of course it is

![RottenApple](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/09/RottenApple-150x137.jpg)Will people please stop using Quicktime for movies!  Out of all the possible formats, why choose the format that is the least cross-browser friendly, has annoying plugins setup for mozilla browsers, and the software is just full of adware, and annoying unwanted addtions to startup.  On Linux, it even more hassle!  Kill the MOVs!  There is no need or use for them.  I know the MAC world is a little "precious", but surely making a video codec for use on websites, that penalises PC users, limits your audience somewhat.  But very very Apple.
