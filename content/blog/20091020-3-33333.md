# 3.33333....

I have had a frustrating time with the joke that is 3 (or "three", or just plain "shit").  Not only is their mobile broadband some kind of cruel joke, but they have a terrible webiste for topping up, which means rather nicely, it is easy to skip important, but seemingly needless step of CONVERTING your top-up to broadband, or be charged a £1 a Mb.  Oh, wait a second, I can see a reason for this poor usability ...  I am sure many other cusotmers have experienced the frustration of the top-up system on 3. Annoyingly easy to get lost, and end up in strange places.  There are 3/4 different routes on the site to getting a top-up.  Messages abbout converting your top-up SOMETIMES appear, but sometimes your account display gives indication it has happened already.  Their desktop messaging chooses to promptly inform you when you need to topup, but fails to help beyond that point. No doubt because of that pesky credit crunch), 3 decided to change corporate policy to that of a conman. Great move for a dying company - make sure they can cream as much cash personally before the 3 disappears into the ground. I will only pass your eventual corporate grave, in order to urinate on it. And maybe something else ...
