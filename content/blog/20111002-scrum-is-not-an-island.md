# SCRUM is not an island

> ![SCRUM](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/10/shutterstock_68545114.jpg)In 1986, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, computer, photocopier, and printer industries.[1] They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth".

The first time I encountered SCRUM in 2001. The development manager was utilising pair-programming and daily standups. The project failed, largely through chronic mistakes made with market analysis. But it did introduce me to a new concept of telling a group of people what I had been doing, and what I was going to do. Just a simple idea, as all the best ones are. SCRUM has been inexorably tied up with Agile methodology, but it predates its formal manifesto (2001). It addresses a key problem in projects, which is momentum. All human beings need a reason to do something with full committment. Deadlines are there not only for clients, but driving a project forward to a known point in time. So it logically follows that the deadlines of releases also will create momentum towards the final goal. The concept of daily meetings is again, not new. These short daily standups keep a project on track, but all involved knowing whatever anyone else is doing, and allows a forum where blockers and other concerns can be raised. Planning on Agile projects are challenging, given the short increments, and the necessary connstant reviews and changes that are inevitable. SCRUM is largely focussed on this area of project (Agile on the software development process). Because of Agile's driving focus, which is rapid iterative software development, it needs as strong process that is enforced. SCRUM addresses the project management side of Agile, devolving the role of Project Manager in Product Owner (or Product Manager) and Scrummaster. What SCRUM includes in its roles are:- 

  * ScrumMaster - who maintains the processes (typically in lieu of a project manager)
  * Product Owner, who represents the stakeholders and the business
  * The “Team”, a cross-functional group who do the actual analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.
Notice the last role? It isn't a role at all, it the people who make SDLC happen. This is where Agile steps in. If the Scrummaster is weak, then you might as well drop SCRUM to start with. Too often with SCRUM, the focus is on it as a development solution rather than a project management one. Agile and SCRUM require radical rethinking of planning, more change than most traditional project managers can handle (hence evolution of Waterscrum and Scrummerfall). Its an imperfect world, and Agile projects generally do partly succeed, but a lot depends on the team you have. In fact if you have the right team together, then methodology is virutally inconsequential. A good developer knows the importance of the testers, and also the stakeholder. This should be a mutual respect, and makes for a very cohesive team. Maybe just my opinion but there is something always omitted from Agile planning which is pace of momentum. To drive your project team into the ground, simply try and apply same pace all the time. Human beings work better in a slingshot fashion - slow build-up leading to more powerful movement. This is the way to operate Sprints, not by Sprint just sliding into each other release after release. I thought it was just me and my quirks, but people respond better and more consistently when there is time to reflect, learn from, and feel proud of what has just passed.
