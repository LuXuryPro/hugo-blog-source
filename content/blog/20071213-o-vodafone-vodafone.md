# O vodafone, vodafone .....

O vodafone, vodafone ..... how much can you annoy your customers?  You have excelled!

1.  The multiple calls from voicemail telling me I have a message, then prompting me to call back on the same number you call from, instead of relaying my voicemails on that phone call.

2.  The multiple calls from voicemail which dont stop until I delete the voicemail message, except when ....

3.  The multiple calls from voicemail telling me I have a message, even when there isnt one.

4.  The multiple text messages telling me I have voicemail, just in case you havent annoyed me enough with the multiple calls.

5.  The final pisstake was three repeated voicemails at 5am this morning, for messages I had already listened.
