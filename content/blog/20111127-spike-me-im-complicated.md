# Spike

With rapid development comes need for rapid decisions - and as pre-emptive as possible! 

> [Spikes are] So-called because a spike is "end to end, but very thin", like driving a spike all the way through a log. _[Spike Described](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SpikeDescribed) :  Alaistair Cockburn_

Spikes are for tough development or design problems, that require more debate over solution. Spike solution is from [Exteme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html) methodology.  It is essentially experimentation, aimed at avoid endemic issues later on.  The more rapid the development, the more you will rely on this type of approach.  This is where the whole team feedback is imperative to identify area that require spiking, and The best way to implement a spike is to create a small program or test that demonstrates the feature in question.   Testers can be intrumental in this effort, as if they have done their test planning and scripting thoroughly enough,  that alone can highlight spike-relevant problems. Although in the regions of experimental work, this can still be fed right back in the the Acceptance Testing process, it's still [ATDD](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/2011/11/13/project-transparency-with-atdd-dsl/).  Many of the experiments/tests will be dropped in the process - of course, that's logical as there is one final solution.  When developing spike solutons, it's important to keep in mind they should be focussed on problem in hand, not for re-use - that will change the developer/tester approach.  It challenges people to re-evaluate what they consider best use of time - focussing on end goal rather than path, in this case.  [Lean software development](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/2011/11/14/lean-development/) has adopted spiking and [kanban](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/2011/10/29/from-scrum-to-kanban/) (which match well).  This is not superseding good principles of reusable code - its a valid tangential approach to unplanned-for task complications. This system of experimentation happens naturally at management level, but rarely at development level - largely because experimentation during Sprints is largely discouraged (mistake of still viewing a Sprint as purely a milestone release). On the other hand, coordinated experimentation can be very valuable.
