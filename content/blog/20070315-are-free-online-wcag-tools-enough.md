# Are free online WCAG tools enough?

As I am part of a venture focussed on usability and web 2.0 heuristics testing services (userexperience20), I have been checking what is currently around.Â Our ultimate aim to to create automated software for the purpose, but something as critical as web accessibility conformance is hard to automate, in principle.Â There are many sites offering online free WCAG validations ... ![webxact](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/webxact.jpg)Â Webxact was recommended to me by an old work colleague.Â I ran this site through it, and got a Level 2 pass on web accessibility.Â Reading through the [WCAG guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT), this seems a little unlikely.Â I was happy enough with level 1, for the purpose of this site, and constantly re-develop to improve.Â But I was unwilling to take webexact's word for level 2 compliance.Â When I ran through the WCAG guidelines on web accessibility myself, I found (as I suspected) the site was not level 2 compliant.Â My history is in QA management, and in that capacity I have had varying experience with test automation.Â Although it has accelerated a lot the last few years, I still believe right tool for right job.Â And in the case of WCAG, manual verification is the only surefire method currently, to ensure your site conforms.Â When we scoped for the automation side, we realised it was a task, as effectively we are not only testing for coding and design standards.Â We are performing these checks in context - a key factor that is missing from the automation process.Â As well as the general time-honoured warning of free services,Â it is aÂ dangerousÂ companyÂ policy to rely on tools such as this, if they are seriously aiming to comply with the guidelines.Â They offer no real verification, and have no affiliation to independant watchdogs, and can provide no real "trustmark" as to authenticity of their claims.
