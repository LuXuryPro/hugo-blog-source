# What %$*! is Agile

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/fixedbidagile1-330x440.jpg)

> Know what happens when you taste 99% pure chocolate? The taste is so powerful it can be unpleasant. The same is true about agile software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology and testing. Between Scrum Masters, schedules, specifications, requirements, sprints, test first, and user stories, many forms of testing - including load and performance testing, stress testing, and integration testing - can get lost. [Where Agile Testing and Test Management Collide](http://www.pushtotest.com/agile-testing-test-management)

Agile is a philosophy, and SCRUM is the most popularly adopted practice (project management methodology). The popular misconception is that SCRUM is a development methodology, when it's not - but it has become one. I have been guilty of same confusion, but I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. Project management and development do have to work in sync, to achieve common goals. Agile has muddied the water, through its adoption as a fashionable term. Agile itself was inspired by the XP approach in Open Source development - rapid development, peer reviews, and a lot of creativity. Agile software development is an appraoch to software development characterized by an emphasis on people, communication, working software, and responding to change. It does not define plans or process, just means to achieve them. The key lessons learnt from Waterfall approach was how the hiearchical nature of the methodology left no room for adapting quickly, and how requirements are sometimes lost or diluted in the chain. Very much dependant on arriving at "finished" product. In development, it is definitely the journey, not the destination, that is most important. To achieve goal in software projects, the path to the solution is never a straight one, and nor should it be. Shortcuts in development were more likely to happen in Waterfall environment, as if a project is working in Agile fashion, impacts of code changes are more readily found and fixed, that in the more rigid release to test framework of Waterfall. Regards day-to-day development - this is largely left to developers to organise themselves in terms of dealing with user stories and associated tasks. Can you see the weak spot already? The mistake commonly made is simply apply Agile/SCRUM label to a project, and somehow things would magically happen. Hence why on projects development can end up running riot, or simply following part-paths, and maintaining a closed-shop to "outsiders". Now that is where the Scrummaster is highly valuable - to ensure that both stakeholder expectations and development planning and managed in parallel - it takes a unique set of skills to do this role. Now Waterfall didnt get it that wrong - it just aged badly, and like most archaic systems, is taking a while to leave. Which is why by far the most common term (first picked up around 2006), is "Waterscrum" - SCRUM implemented with Waterfall style 

> When an organization moves from Waterfall to Agile processes, they have to change more than just how to track the delivery of code. They have to change the practices of coding as well as the methods used to govern investment and manage risk. [Waterscrum vs Scrummerfall](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickmalik/archive/2007/06/04/waterscrum-vs-scrummerfall.aspx)

It has been on many websites, but here they are again: the 4 fundamental principles of Agile:- 

  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a plan
Unfortunately too many people read "instead of" for "over"! I am more familiar with unstructured and sometimes chaotic project environments, and I am usually brought in to do a bit of testing firefighting at the same time as defining and promoting process changes in project and development management. I like that style of working - bringing order to chaos. In spite them being latecomers to world of QA, they are willing to embrace what it has to offer, and Agile/SCRUM has gone a long way to both damage and promote perception of testing. I have lost count of the number of bizarre implementations of Agile/SCRUM I have come across, and applying a few good QA principles can work wonders. Having a bad experience of Agile implementation can put a company off trying again. Whatever the issues with the implementation of the methodology, the methodology itself is generally blamed. Agile doesn't suit all companies, as there is an assumption of everyone's dedicated time and effort on the project, and the different working cultures. 

> Agile development methodology attempts to provide many opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle .... In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development — requirements, design, etc. — is continually revisited throughout the lifecycle. When a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there’s always time to steer it in another direction.
