# JS-Kit: Navigator service

![jskit](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/07/jskit-300x160.png)Another attempt to control and own data, or truly semantic service?  First look and play seems to prove the later.  Data has become a commodity far beyond selling email addresses and other personal data.  Data has extended into profiling, i.e. ceasing to be just a web user, but an integrated part of the www.  A profile (which be stoired in variety of formats, notably APML), contain web surfing data, identifying web users interests and patterns of behaviour.   Generally considered to be a voluntary activity, it does not stop some web services with backdoor policy of retaining and using data (if you can be bothered to read EULAs, it wont take you long to find an example). Onto JSKit, which appears to be some form of portal, geared at traffic generation through supply of social networking services in a hub.  As with web 2.0 services, there is relaicne on user to build up profiles, as well as utulising other user-generated content to gather results.  These results are in areas of site commenting, ratings, polls and advisor (aggregation of rating-type information).  I prefer the control of APML profiling route, but the services are still lagging.  It will take a while for more widely supported generic profiling services - but in the meatime, tools like this are worth a look.
