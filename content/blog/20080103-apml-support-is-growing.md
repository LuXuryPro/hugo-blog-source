# APML Support is growing

>   * **Attention** is the term given to the entire scope of what you consume and ‘pay’ interest to – be it websites, books, songs, etc.
>   * **Attention Profile** is a metadata payload of that attention, in the form of keywords (or themes) and weightings, which help score how much attention you pay a given keyword. The idea is that a system tracking your attention could generate such a profile which could then be easily ported to another application and processed accordingly. (APML is a proposed XML format for this payload)

I am sure now that most of the popular social bookmarking sites will offer more microformat export possibilities, and magnolia has been one of the first. Its a good time to start building your own profile(s), using such services as engagd.com and cluztr.com.
