# Usability Testing

Identify website strengths and weaknesses, and understand how your users experience your website. There are many benefits of usability testing, including evaluating the usability of a system, during and after design. For example a site redesign, usability test approach can provide redesign options that are both pragmatic and budget-conscious fashion.  The end result of any usability testing is an improved product and a better understanding of the users that you are designing for.  Functional & Design Usability We understand that modern web ‘users’ are now ‘consumers’ or ‘customers’, and judge more harshly than before. Poor design can affect the user experience from the first point of entry, and functionality can make basic actions overly complex, or just plain confusing. Putting the user first in the functionality and design process results in greater efficiency, learning time, and satisfaction. Web Accessibility Audit (WCAG) Increasingly, Usability and Web Accessibility (WCAG) are coming head-to-head with each other, and rich interactive interfaces often can’t be made fully accessible. While it is not necessary to fully compromise your site, it is advisable to conform to as many accessibility standards as is practically possible. The main benefit of using a Web Accessibility Audit to evaluate your website is that Accessibility Audits are significantly cheaper and quicker than lengthier accessibility testing. Web 2.0 Web 2.0 signified a shift in the way websites were developed, and the web site assumed role of contributor, rather than a viewer. It’s fashionable, attracts the Nathan Barley crowd, but most importantly it is a very testable set of technologies to empower the user, pushing your website beyond just a static billboard. Aggregation, syndication, networking and microformats are sound future-proofing principles when approaching website design, and will improve SEO rating. Identifying web 2.0 technologies that are relevant to you and your business is part of the service. Interested in low cost adhoc usability testing? Click here for more details.
