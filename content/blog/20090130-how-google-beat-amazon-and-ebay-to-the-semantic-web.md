# How Google beat Amazon and Ebay to the Semantic Web

![googlebot](http://www.ftrain.com/art/graphics/place/googlebot_earth2.png) For me, I have always believed that adopting a semantic web stance now, in your development and strategy.  This will set you up for the long-term.  You wont hurriedly be changing code or web strategy in a few years time if you get into the right mindset now.  Design is important, but all too often it ends up driving development. Wrong!  Data and functionality first - the pretty little dress can go on later.  Not widely understood but well coded websites are ranked higher by search engines (especially Google).  They are also more liekly to comply with SEO and Web Accessibility standards.  So why is it such an arduous task to fight the case for standards?  Because no-one is interested in something they cannot see, that is not instantly obvious.  Semantic web sounds good in theory, but if it starts becoming the reason why sales have to compromise on their new state-of-the-art flash banner campaigns, then its popularity soon diminishes.  But I will stay on the case, as I know it is the only way to approach web development for now and future.
