# Test Analyst or Exploratory Tester?

After contributing to and reading discussions about Exploratory testing, it struck me that what we have is a kind of project generation gap. i.e. people who started in IT pre or post Agile. Exploratory testing is what I would call test analysis, an assumed skilled for a tester when I started. When modern methods started to gain ground in development world, test analysis was a gaping hole, as the idea was that testing was already mapped out by user stories, and any changes would again be transferred through to testing. This led to daft assumption that the tester was not only a purely functional role, but on occasions redundant (with the cry of "anyone can be a tester!). Fast forward a decade, and there is general acceptance that QA in general was lacking. So testing itself was analysed further, and shock/horror, there seems to be some evidence that testers can think for themselves, and that it can be a field of expertise. i.e. a role, not just a function. And what I would call test analysis had been re-branded exploratory testing. The cycnic in me says this is because Agile, and it's inspired ilk, plain forgot to include testing, with any depth, in their process ramblings (the same with project management). So in order to address this oversight, without highlighting errors in the own methodology, test analysis became Exploratory testing. And so onto a lot of strange discussions from indignant managers wondering what an earth testers were doing, testing outside of strict requirements. If it was a product off a manufacturing line, I could understand - but software? The hysteria has been comical, but at the same time, annoying. Even people of my generation and older seem to have got caught up in the hysteria. Now there is talk of Exploratory testing as specialism, leading perhaps to role of "Exploratory Tester" (oh, come on!). So Test Analyst is in danger of being "rebranded", and at the same time, giving consultancies have another weapon in their Agile-paranoia services arsenal. It will only do more damage than good - though encouraging testers to be good test analysts is worthwhile cause.
