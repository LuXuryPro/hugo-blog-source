# My first and last attempt to make whole website in flash

![Wayback Machine Beta](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/logo_WM.png)Thanks to joy of http://waybackmachine.org/ - it holds cached copies of web pages stretching back to mid-90's. Earliest Google site version:- http://replay.waybackmachine.org/19981111184551/http://google.com/ Below, I managed to retrieve an old swf file I thought I had lost using same site. My first and last attempt to make whole website in flash - I truly recognised at that point that design just wasn't my area - I found it stressful! Good design is a pleasure to look at, and can only admire those who can truly make flash dance (no cheesy pun intended).
