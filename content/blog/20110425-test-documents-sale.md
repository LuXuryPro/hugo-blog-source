# Test Documents Sale!

If like me, and you work on a lot of test projects, templates are essential! So garnered from over 15 years in the QA contract business, I am offering collection of test documentation covering test strategies, test plans, test scripts, test reports, lifecycle diagrams, test standards checks (coding, accessibility, mobile readiness, usability, SEO). Also included are examples of usability reviews/reports and lifecycle diagrams (Agile/SCRUM methodology) There are **over 200 documents** covering media, publishing and mobile projects.  To make them useful, I have left content largely intact, for your customisations.  A quick route to kick-starting your test project in organised and logical manner. Please email [enquiry@jaffamonkey.com](mailto:enquiry@jaffamonkey.com?subject=documentation), and I will send you an example document, and payment link (Bundle Cost: $99). Specify which test document type you are interested in, and I will send you a relevant example.
