# A free SSH client, that I have used many...

![Mindterm](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/03/AGmindterm.jpg)A free SSH client, that I have used many times over the years - I like its simplicity, and it speedy transfer performance over SFTP/SCP (its not just connectivity that affects tranfer rates). Download from [here](http://www.cryptzone.com/products/agmindterm/download.aspx) \- you just need Java installed to run (no computer admin rights necessary for install, as it runs from one JAR file)
