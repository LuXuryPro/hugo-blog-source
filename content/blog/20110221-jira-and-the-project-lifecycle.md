# JIRA and the project lifecycle

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/ReleaseToTest-170x170.png)Using JIRA to its full potential is all about implementing a decent workflow - and that doesnt mean just setting up the JIRA workflows, its the people workflow. When companies buys tools like this, what is often forgotten is it has to be "sold" to the users. Too often JIRA languishes, treated as another "bugzilla" - when in fact it is very geared to a full project lifecycle (with some weaknesses).
