# Interactive Fiction Programming

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/Panel14.png)Worth a look - I was searching around for different examples of programming lanmguages and came across Inform. Inform is "A Design System for Interactive Fiction Based on Natural Language". An example of its implementation is here http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/glass/index.html. And here is a list of others you can have a look at - http://inform7.com/learn/complete-examples. Before trying to actual program file, you will need to download an interpreter to use it, if you don't want to commit to entire Inform http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/unix/zoom/ [vimeo width="450" height="300"]http://www.vimeo.com/4221277[/vimeo]
