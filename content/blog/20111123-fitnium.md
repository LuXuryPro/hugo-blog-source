# Fitnium

> Combination of FitNesse and Selenium, providing a domain specific langauge that allows non-developers to write selenium tests in plain english that are executed through the Fitnesse framework.

Fitnium - the closest I have seen to decent attempt to use Selenium with Fitnesse. The reason I gravitate towards Fintesse is largely down to recent experience with BDD and Kanban. The strengths but also the dangers of these methodologies is the focus on requirements, and keeping up to speed with changes or new requirements. ![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif)The path from user story to code can be a convoluted one, even if you have the right methodology in place. The right tools are important, as these are used daily by the team. Calls to have pretty scrum boards, graphs and better UI's may be met with derision, but they are important. Why? Because we are dealing with human beings. Administering project tools can end up a large daily task in itself, whcih defeats the object. Fitnesse is not "pretty" but very functional, and usable at all project levels. If you want to make it prettier there are custom stylesheets, but of course the important question is what does Fitnesse do? Fitnesse is an Acceptance Testing Framework, designed to be implemented ideally at start of a project, when user stories and scenarios are being defined. Code is developed and referenced from these requirements, and Fitnesse has built functions to automate tests (at code level). At any point, anyone can go into Fintesse and runs tests against the current requirements as behind the "real language" requirement items, is relevant code. The requirements are updated, then code has to be added/changed to ensure the test still works. This is essentially a wider scope of TDD approach, called ATTD (Acceptance Test Driven Development). This alone can help a project stay on track, but there is missing element to this description - how is Fitnesse connecting to code? Wit the help of various client drivers supporting myriad of development, it is easy to connect Fitnesse to source control, but the developer or tester still needs to do some more work behind the scenes of Fitnesse to represent scenarios in scripting form. Fitnesse has it's own scripting language for this. While Unit Tests focuses more on the design of the code and the functional correctness on a unit level (as in: per class) and Functional tests focus more on the UI and flow of pages, Fitnesse fills the gap between those areas. Fitnesse focuses on the correct behaviour of Business Logic. Fitnesse does this without the need for a UI, but it focus is much wider than a single unit of work. Fitnesse allows complete scripts of business functionality to be tested, with complete integration in the system. Also, because Fitnesse tests are not concerned with implementation details, Fitnesse Tests can be written Test First, allowing a fully integrated TDD approach from a requirement level, which isn't possible with most other frameworks. It would be even more ideal to also have UI-driven tests, for certain case scenarios. For example, automated testing at code level won't highlight same issues as when that same code is tested from front-end perspective. And this is where the Fitnesse/Selenium pairing comes to the fore. Fitnium creates an easy bridge between Fitnesse and executing Selenium-style intructions, by means of extension of Fitnesse's scripting language. Fitnium takes it a step further by encouraging scenarios to be written in style that is both understandable to all but also provides the developer with good instruction on what code to produce (domain-specific language (DSL)). Although programming languages various is style and format, fundamental elements remain similar and can be experessed in a common style. And as Fitnesse works in hierarchical style, you can optimise your scenarios as a programmer would, and create and utilise shared scenarios in scripts. Â Fitnium simply extends what Fitnesse provides already, to incorporate calls to selenium without having to hand-code Selenium tests.
