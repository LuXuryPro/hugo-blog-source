# NoSQL

NoSQL systems have already been used successfully in large projects, and they were developed specifically for these high-volume, high-traffic scenarios. Many organisations use them:- BBC, CERN (LHC), Adobe, Mozilla, Facebook, Meetup, Ning, Stumbleupon, Twitter, Yahoo!, Disney, Craiglist, Foursquare, Bit.ly, SourceForge, GitHub, Grooveshark, EA, LinkedIn, Google, Cisco WebEx, AOL, Apple, eBay. 

> NoSQL DEFINITION: Next Generation Databases mostly addressing some of the points: being non-relational, distributed, open-source and horizontally scalable. The original intention has been modern web-scale databases. The movement began early 2009 and is growing rapidly. Often more characteristics apply such as: schema-free, easy replication support, simple API, eventually consistent / BASE (not ACID), a huge amount, of data  and more. So the misleading term "nosql" (the community now translates it mostly with "not only sql") should be seen as an alias to something like the definition above.
