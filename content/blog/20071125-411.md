# Greasemonkey

[Microformats](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) have now really started something, after a few years in the undergorund nerd-world. As usual, it takes the enthusiasts to keep things evolving, even when no immediate application can be worked out. Beyond the well-used rss microformat, which is used for general contnet syndication and aggregation, other microformats such as hcalendar and hcard are getting some attention. makedatamakesense.com offers proxy services, using firefox extensions todeliver this service.

[Greasemonkey ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748)is a scripting language for firefox extensions, that has opened up browser development to the masses. I can now sort of see why some predict the end of search engines, if ll the onus of hunting will be down to browser effectiveness with extracting and processing microformat data. A simplistic view, as I still believe that search engines have a big part to play in the semantic web.
