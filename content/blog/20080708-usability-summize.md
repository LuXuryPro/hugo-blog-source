# Summize - Twitter search engine

![](http://summize.com/images/summize-logo-small.png?1212012034) Great search engine for Twitter, with resulting feed available for the search query.Â  Another good thing about Twitter is that people give opinions more readily than other social networking apps, and that is down to the ease of update by text, email, and web.
