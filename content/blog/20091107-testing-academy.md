# Testing Academy

![](http://www.testingacademy.com/images/topSky.jpg)On perlease!  The "testing academy"?   This is just embrassing for a testing services site - though was doubled up how awful it was - especially the hammy indiscreet (and very short) tester diary. For a start there dont have a link to their front page anywhere on their site, and a rather lacklustre offering as a whole. I found them through a reference to this site from someone on the [softwaretestclub group](http://www.softwaretestingclub.com/group/Nigeriatester?groupUrl=Nigeriatester&id=751045:Group:38218&page=2#comments) \- strange, given my experience, that I dont run across these people.  But from the look of it, their efforts is focussed on blue chip company projects, largely ignorant of testing practices. This site is a scam or a sham - either way, avoid! Link below is to the "tester diary" - good for a laugh for some testers ramblings about agile, though seemed to have given up pretty quick.  Probably just made up, but maybe its a short diary because he never found more work, because he was inept.  Its 50/50 and not good either way.
