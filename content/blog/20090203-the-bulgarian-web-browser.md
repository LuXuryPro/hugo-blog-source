# The Bulgarian Web Browser

![](http://www.web-visions.info/images/webvisionslogo.png) This browser has received a lot of hype - so much so I thought it was some kind of phishing scam or viral marketing.  Since every reference to it includes phrase "the Bulgarian web browser", I assume a lot of the hype is where it was developed.  It has been developed in Visual Basic Express, which came as a surprise, given the selection of modern development environments.   So very much a Windows/MAC browser (doubt there will be a Linux version, not if they are using MS for development tools). It did start blistering quickly, but the important factor is how it performs once it starts up.  All plugins necessary are there and correct, and sites load marginally faster than IE/Firefox.  but struggling to see the point of this browser, beyond have a clean fast browser, with no additional features.  No History, no favourites, but maybe this browser makes more sense in modern web world.  Do I use Favourites?  I don’t need too, I have my social bookmarking sites for that.  Do I need to view History?  Sometimes convenient, but if you are a reasonably organised surfer, this is not needed. If you are after a fast clean browser, with no features/plugins/add-ons to slow it down, then it is a good functional choice.  But I would recommend the underused Seamonkey, if you are after a cross-OS supported browser, with standard browser features you have come to expect.  Black Label  this is good as any - Lynx principles, with graphical UI (hold on, why haven’t Lynx done that!).
