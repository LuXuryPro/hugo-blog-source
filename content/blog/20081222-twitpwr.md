When you use the **TwitPwr short url service,** they track the number of clicks that you drive via the Twitter API, and give your account a **Power Rating.**  
  
Your **Power Rating** is not only the unique traffic that you generate, but it's also based on how many Twitter users you refer to our service, and how much traffic they generate through unlimited generations.
