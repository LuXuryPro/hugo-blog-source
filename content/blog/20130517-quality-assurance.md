# BDD

> "Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the store: six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station." You can hear these words recited 1,300 times at the [online speech accent archive](http://accent.gmu.edu) at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia â€“ and every one is different.

I guess it's probably a little obvious where this is leading too, in context of a technical blog - a comparison with requirements. While I realise BDD is not the whole solution to development, it does keep focus on key area, which is what the client wants. It doesn't take long for requirements to become muddied by people's different take on them. A thoroughly underestimated skill, is writing user stories that are both effective for the client view and the developers guidance. BDD sought to use DSL to bring requirements closer to code, by creating a partly-automated path from a user story (or feature), to automated test script that essentially defined the pseudo code that a developer could use to produce the functioning code. The theory is easy to sell, but it requires high skills in analysis and coding, to truly work. And never assume BDD to be a whole solution - we are a way off that point yet!
