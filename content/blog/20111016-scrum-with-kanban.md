# Scrum with Kanban

Good demonstration of how well Scrum and Kanban can work together - most adopt a Scrum vs Kanban appraoch, which totally skirts round fact they can exist together. Scrum for the project management and Kanban for development. Keeping Scrum can measure levels of success of Kanban, on the path to stakeholder delivery.
