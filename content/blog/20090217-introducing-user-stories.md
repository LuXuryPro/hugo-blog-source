# Introducing User Stories

![introducing-user-stories](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/introducing-user-stories-150x150.jpg)[Agile Software Development: Introducing User Stories - PowerPoint Presentation](http://www.agile-software-development.com/2008/02/introducing-user-stories-powerpoint.html) User stories are one of those areas of Agile (and in earlier form, Extreme Programming) so simple, you can tie yourself in knots trying to explain it.  This is one of many presentations explaining the principles.  The like the elevator analagy - if you cant explain your user story in less than 30 seconds, it is probably too long.  Less than 10 seconds, it is probably too short, and needs combining into a longer user story. Remember, a user story is just a placeholder for more detailed conversations, not a specification or requirements document. There is also a nice example [here](http://open.ncsu.edu/se/tutorials/coffee_maker/), based on coffee making, something close to my heart :)
