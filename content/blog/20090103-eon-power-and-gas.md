# E.ON - Power and Gas

![](http://www.eon.com/graphics/common/logo_eon_printversion_129x93.gif) Although the English service record has always been particularly poor, utilities companies seem to employ people with part of their brains missing.  I recently moved into new flat, and dutifully informed Eon of the change of tenant.  I now get two bills regularly twice a week - one billed to The Occupier for bill prior to me moving in, and one also addressed to "The Occupier" for subsequent bill.  Now it seems to me that they have obviously received my details, as the date up to, and date from, on the bills tallies.  Maybe they are hoping I will pay both bills to save them administration.  Must be so complicated changing one name to another - obviously is for a UK company, especially lazy inept parasitic ones like Eon. BT also step up to the mark on this one, but in a manner intended to confuse and worry you enough to pay up regardless.  They are a far more shameless bunch of idiots, and in process of taking them to court, as we cannot allow companies to feel they can bully - that is simply plain cowardice on their part. Actually I am missing the point - you want to screw more money out of your customers - apply unreasonable inflation-busting charges, keep the intimidation letters flowing, and hire idiots to administer - pure credit-crunch brilliance!  It worked for The Tube, National Rail, etc.  Incompetence should be rewarded, and now is in the UK - welcome to world of "Nathan Barley", an oft referenced comedy from the very astute Chris Morris (and Charlie Brooker). I am not too churlish not to wish all a happy new year, so Happy New Year Eon and BT! ..... you bunch of morons.
