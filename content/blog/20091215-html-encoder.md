# HTML Encoder

Another simple useful online tool I use regularly.  It is often forgotten how machines/software process data.  yes, most systems are very forgiving and understand what a space or quotemark is.  But this all adds to overhead. 

Machine-friendly data is what the semantic web is all about - how you enter data in a system backend is driving factor to the speed and quality of how data is delivered to frontend.  Most systems will do this for you, but why not lend it a helping hand and observe some quality standards.  We may be in advanced technological stage, but machines are still fundamentally basic entities that will only do what we tell them to do, and unlike humans, wont complain. 

PC/Server architecture hasnt progressed that much, it's the development languages and techniques that have - worth remembering!  And this evolvement has simply been to add more layers shielding the fundamentals of machine program execution, binary, i.e. 1's & 0's.

I am not suggesting that all data entry should be this way!  But when static data is embedded in code, then even more essential to use html encoding.
