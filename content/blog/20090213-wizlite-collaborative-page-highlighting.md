# Wizlite | Collaborative Page Highlighting

Wizlite allows you to highlight text (like on real paper) on any page on the Internet and share it with everybody (or just your friends).

Though aimed at collaboration, I am using this to bookmark is more specific way.  Though there is no replacement  for bookmarking website URLs, this is an easy way to centrally store bookmarks, with site extracts.  So you never have to go back to the actual site, you have the bookmakred site extracts in one place.  These extracts are updated, if the website they were extracted one is updated.
