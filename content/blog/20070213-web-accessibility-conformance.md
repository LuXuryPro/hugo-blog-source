# Web Accessibility Conformance

Web accessibility conformance criteria has been around for a while, but only recently has become a high-profile requirement. The UK government's web accessibility site last year, (that only worked in IE6+, and required numerous plugins!), was an example about the misconceptions of what web accessibility means, and what it's boundaries are. In some countries I know it is also a legal requirement, as well as a sociological one. This interests me from business and development perspective, and I wanted to find out what development, and/or business restrictions effects could be? I know in media-driven projects, for example, this could necessitate an complete overhaul of design and programming (inlcuding human resoruces) - and a potentially expensive exercise. This is an effort to find out general concerns about this level of control on websites, and if they are warranted. My good friends at Segala have a good summary of web accessibility "laws", for reference. http://segala.com/services/overview_webaccess.htm
