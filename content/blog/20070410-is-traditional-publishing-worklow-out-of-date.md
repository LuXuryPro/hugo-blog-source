# The last few contracts I have done were ...

The last few contracts I have done were centred on international publishing projects, and what transpired was that the old publishing workflow is out of date and costly. From a technology angle, it is a convoluted process, that relies on human intervention at key stages. One solution is for trusted authors to create and publish with no intervention, very akin to bogging philosophy. Is this really the way forward for professional online publishing - with no control? On the face of it, it appears to be an extreme solution - it is in my way, therefore get it out of my way. Rather dull, but middle ground is needed here. In a publishing firm, the assumption is that you have journalists/authors/editors/sub-editors, etc..... This workflow cannot be rewritten overnight - the nature of print media is reliance on the human eye and experience. An automated workflow cannot take this into consideration. So, the middle ground - where is it? Unfortunately, there isnt one that doesnt rely on triggers to move an article through the authorisation system. If no-one is available to authorise a publish, then the article will simply remain in a review state. In the real world, there would always be someone an author could contact to push something through. Now this can be accommodated by the system, but would entail the buy-in of the editors and publishers to react to system notifcations, and to regularly check them. The middle ground needs both sides to make a move to provide a system fit for publishing purpose.
