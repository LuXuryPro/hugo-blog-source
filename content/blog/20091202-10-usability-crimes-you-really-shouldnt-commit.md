# 10 Usability Crimes You Really Shouldn’t Commit

![](http://line25.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/usability-crimes/crime4.png)It never hurts to re-iterate the basics, but also painful that they have to be.  The 10 fundamentals listed here should be caught by code quality checks.  It is important in testing not only to verify from front-end, but havign a quick check behind the code to check for standards such as meaningful ALT tags, form field ids and labels, etc.  There are [several tools to help the tester with this](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/2009/10/05/5-quick-effective-steps-for-emergency-testing/), but really development should be addressing this, as these simple pitfalls can b e easily avoided observing coding standards.  Not applying this standards at this level is just plain laziness.
