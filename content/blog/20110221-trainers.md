# Trainers

![Adidas Supernova Trainers ](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/mytrainers.jpg)I obsessively run, but never blogged about it. Guess I don't see the point - I love pounding the london pavements after dark. Since I passed the 40-mark, been getting more conscious of damage, so sought our some trainers the maturer runner :) I have gone through a lot of trainers, from dodgy "almost real" supersports versions - even tried to run in boarder trainers when I was stuck without my usual pair (don't do that, unless you want severe Achilles pain). [Adidas Supernova](http://shop.adidas.co.uk/product/MH635/U44120/Sports/Men's-Supernova-Glide-3/detail.jsf) are just amazing - they are stable road running shoes, but happy over a bit of rough too. The real nice bit is when you suddenly increase speed, when you truly get the "3D" effect, as the cushionning in the heel seems to turn into a real springboard. Just click on link above - not sure how much is marketing bollocks, but I haven't been getting any Achilles or heel pain since I started using them.
