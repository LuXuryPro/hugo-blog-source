# Skipfish

![Skipfish Default Output](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/skipfish_output-323x440.png)Now onto another command line based security testing tool called Skipfish. You can download and compile source, or yum for package (**yum install skipfish**). Now navigate to a directory where you want to output results directory to be created (or you can enter specific path in the command string). The [Skipfish help page](http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/wiki/SkipfishDoc) gives you many examples to try, but the first suggested usage is:- 

> ./skipfish -o **enter desired results output directory name** http://www.example.com/some/starting/path/

Despite the command line being off-putting to most, it is quick and easy, and generates some good reports. Click on thumbnail to see of output using above command line string.
