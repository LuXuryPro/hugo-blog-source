# Websockets and multiplayer gaming

One area that websockets can really prove itself on is online multi-player gaming, where latency issues can really become apparent. In this short video, which is a facebook racing game, you can notice the latency issues immediately, with the race countdown. Again, it's all about perception - because the end-user is not aware of latency issues, and is not sitting next to the person they are playing with, they make assumptions based on their own user experience.
