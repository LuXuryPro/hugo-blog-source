# Self-facilitating media node

The [Nathan Barley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley) tv series was created by [Charlie Brooker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brooker) and genius [Chris Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29), and was a satire on new media phonies. Based on website series created by Charlie, it poked fun at the surge of "noo-mediuh" types at turn of the millennium.Â Nathan embodied the worst characteristics of these new entrants into the world of the web and technology.

> Nathan Barley is a webmaster, guerrilla filmmaker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a 'self-facilitating media node'. He is convinced he is the epitome of urban cool, and therefore secretly terrified he might not be, which is why he reads _Sugar Ape_ magazine â€” his bible of cool. In reality however his 'output' is of no real interest to anyone but him and his immediate friends. The website consists of stupid pranks caught on camera, photos of him with attractive women and photos of him standing on street corners in major cities around the world (purely to demonstrate that he has enough money to go there). He is of the belief that because he has a camera, some knowledge of web publishing and some webspace, that makes him talented.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Barley Unfortunately the "Nathan Barleys" did not go away too soon, and some became successful and inlfuential. Hence why Nathan Barley the tv series was created at the end of 2005.Â Yep, they are still here, hanging onto digital media like its the holy grail of technology and cool. The web has been drowning in media, mostly inefficient and unnecessary, and now we have to takeÂ several steps back, before we take a step forward. Technology shouldnt be drowned in spin, otherwise that pattern will continue ad infinitum. Main reason for post is not to have another rant (before I dissolve into one!), but to recommend it. I watched it when it was on tv, and have watched it since of DVD. What it highlighted for me was that anything made by Chris Morris, watched now, makes more and more sense .... television and the media certainly has gone Brass Eye.
