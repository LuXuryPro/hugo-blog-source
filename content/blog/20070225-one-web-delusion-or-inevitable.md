# "One Web" - delusion or inevitable?

The current guidelines being pushed by w3c, and the increasing debate on the "one web" (that a website should have ability to be displayed on any device, PC-based or mobile), sound like good aspirations to me, and follow a logical evolutionary path for the web. What is a little disconcerting is the level of resistance to the concept, which I have experienced in companies, and also on the numerous blogs out there. My opinion is that we have been "getting away with it" for too long. Poor coding and design have been prevalent and increasing on the www, so I feel the reactions have been very much akin to toys are being thrown from collective prams. What is your view on "one web"? It is ineveitable, but is it too soon to at least plan and develop sites to this principle?
