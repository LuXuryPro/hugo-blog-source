# 404

![404page](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/404page-150x94.jpg)What a great idea - [a 404 page competition](http://themehybrid.com/archives/2009/07/who-can-create-the-coolest-funniest-smartest-404-page)!  Being run by Wordpress design guru (I only use that word when deserved!) [Justin Tadlock](http://themehybrid.com/archives/author/admin/), the creator of the theme framwework Hybrid (which this blog uses). In QA capacity, 404 pages are often highlighted, as they are usually forgotten or left as a basic default.  But it can be a doorway - best to treat them as another index page.  The user may have arrived by accident but maybe they meant to be there, and just need encouragement :)
