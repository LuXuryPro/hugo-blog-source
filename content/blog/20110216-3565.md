# Useful website audit tool

These tools never replace thorough checks, but this one ([SortSite by Powermapper](http://www.powermapper.com/index.htm)) does a very good job of a quick passthrough of a site checking for:- 

>   * Accessibility - check against W3C WCAG1, WCAG2 and Section 508 guidelines
>   * Compatibility - check for browser specific code, script and image formats
>   * Compliance - check for compliance with EU and US law
>   * Broken Links - check for broken links and other errors
>   * Search Engine Optimization - check Google, Yahoo and Bing webmaster guidelines
>   * Web Standards - validate HTML, XHTML and CSS
>   * Usability - check against Usability.gov guidelines

Test websites for accessibility, broken links, browser compatibility, SEO and over 450 quality issues.
