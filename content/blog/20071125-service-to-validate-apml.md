# Service to validate XML-based playlists

> The question for software developers is why should I support this new XML playlist format? The choice is between M3U and SMIL. Almost every digital music player accepts M3U but also invents an XML playlist format. Inventing a format creates work, for example to study related formats; you should use XSPF to avoid the work. SMIL, on the other hand, is a prescription for a kind of application that is different from a typical music player â€” it describes layouts in time, while XSPF describes concepts common among music players. Given a song with the comment "danceable!", SMIL might have an instruction to write that text in the upper left in a bold sans-serif font, while XSPF would tell a player that the text is a comment and say nothing about formatting.
