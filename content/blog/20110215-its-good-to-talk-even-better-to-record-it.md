# Its good to talk ... even better to record it

So many discussions on the value of issue management in testing world, it's crazy. For starters the assumption is when defending issue management systems, it instantly seems to suggests to people that the tester doesnt communicate with anyone. Communication is important - but so is recording that communication. I come from an older school when communication was paramount, as there werent the tools there are now to assist. Test Management tools should enhance, not replace. And dealing with issue purely using verbal communication does nothing for regression testing and traceability. Issue Management tools primarily provide:- 

  * Highlighting repeated issues (reopened issues are invariably endemic of larger problems)
  * Historical record of issue fixes for future use (how may times have you heard "I fixed it before, but I cant remember what I did")
  * Record of project members communication ("You said I should do it this way" vs "I dont remember saying that!")
To avoid issue management is simply lazy, and short-term thinking. As discussed at length in this article on the [Social Tester](http://thesocialtester.posterous.com/cannot-reproduce), the suggestion is that unreproducibles are largely useless to record. Not so - it happened once, and there is always a reason. It may never be solved, but if it ever appears again, at least there is prior information recorded, and the tester doesnt look like a numpty. To get this clear - issue management systems do not replace conversations - they do hold information and history, and that INCLUDES conversations (if relevant).  In my experience it is not companies exclusively communicating via tracking syste, that is the problem - the problem is too much casual behaviour under guise of  "We are Agile".  Really?  I thought you were just lazy and disorganised!
