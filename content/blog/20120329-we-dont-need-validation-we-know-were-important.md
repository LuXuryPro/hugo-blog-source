# We don't need validation - we know we're important

> Without knowing programming, they [testers] can't have any real insights into the kinds of bugs that come into software and the likeliest place to find them <http://www.sqatester.com/qateam/qualitiesofagoodtester.htm>

That is partially correct - if you are intent on becoming career tester, you cannot avoid the technical knowledge that role demands. But this article demonstrates a problem with perception, and forgetting there are many benefits to testers, who are not bogged down in technical knowledge. Yes, the stakeholders do their UAT, and generally raise issues that weren't foreseen in the general SDLC. The above quote is true, but it's not the whole story - the whole article seems to assume the developer is king on a project. They aren't, the client is (or whoever is holding the money bag). Developers are generally the most vocal in criticisms of tester skills - but my experience is developers can get very defensive, if a tester does have programming skills (the game becomes harder for them to play ;)). I have never written that much about the actual experience of being a tester - in other words, I have never analysed what being a tester means. In light of the pleasant surprising [Forbes poll on happiest jobs](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45gmhl/the-20-happiest-jobs/#gallerycontent), it made me think of why testing could be a happy role. The survey was based on US figures, and I know the world of technology is generally 2/3 years ahead. While we were still suffering projects in Agile delusion, the US were already in "lessons learnt" zone. I believe that survey result points to the positive surge of appreciation of the place of QA, and acknowledgement that it needs to be taken more seriously as a role, rather than a demoted task.

Now it doesn't seem to mean much beyond that you are prepared to work and be paid in that way. Testers were a very different breed to how they are now - far more leaning towards analysis than development. The most important part of a tester was considered to be attention to detail and documentation - how you designed a test case was a basis for judgement, and level of detail over efficiency. What they also possessed with was a pitbull mentality when it came down to chasing up on bugfixes. What hasn't changed is the never-tiresome bug versus change request debates, or the lack of understanding of the value of a tester. One of my first contracts in Belgium was particularly memorable for the Guy le Roche wearing Doncaster lady who reduced the (inept) project manager to tears one day. She was not technical tester, but what she was expert at was Quality Assurance and was pedantic with requirements coverage. To suggest she was a bad tester, based on judging technical skills is just plain wrong. The poor old world of QA - no sooner we make our mark in Agile (after being excluded from the party, for being project dorks), then Lean swoops in. And I am already hearing variations on the old "we don't need a tester" favourite. This phrase is largely used by paranoid developers, or tight-assed project managers. It's annoying - if you haven't got a lot of budget, fine - but why be stupid and risk quality? Stupid is the right world - we are working in commercial world, and I wouldn't want any of my managers demoting quality. Whatever the demands and deadlines, skilled project planning doesn’t simply remove steps to shorten path to the goal. It's lazy and self-defeatist. When Agile popped it's head up, people thought tester as role was on demise, as in Agile the developers and stakeholders do all the testing. This limped along for a while, success largely dependent on competence of development. The surge of projects on the "woollyweb", led to more companies than ever before were exposed to the software development lifecycle. Though many were in denial of that for many years. So the modern tester? Never before has so much been demanded of a tester - analysis skills, automation skills, a myriad of technical knowledge, and understanding of project processes. And something traditionally difficult for people who work in the IT industry - communication. Yet though these are the demands, testers of this calibre are not common - you will find a myriad of individuals performing testing in a company, some of whom have no knowledge of testing process at all. This is all down to differing opinions on what a tester is and/or does. Whatever power a tester is given, it is usually removed the instant the tester becomes "difficult", i.e. stands their ground. The position of Test Manager has always been seen as the lowest of the management roles on a project, and that has not changed that much. In fact, this is probably main reason for demise of role, as testers filled the gap left behind. Let’s not get confused - testing has ALWAYS been a corner that needs enthusiastic defending. In the general course of development/testing banter, there is serious underlying element of win/lose. A good developer needs a good tester to push against, and vice versa. I appreciate my origins more so now, as when I started, testers had to be both thick-skinned and tenacious. No matter how friendly everyone is on a project, when things start to go wrong, and the wagging finger starts to circle ... and QA was common lazy target. And it still can be. I was hoping Agile was going to address the prevalent blame culture, but unfortunately all it did was provide another mask, another tool in the mba-speaking manager's arsenal. It's difficult to see the wood (role) for the trees (contracts) - when you spend most of your working life in a role, it becomes more and more difficult to analyse. Without wishing to blow my own trumpet, I get many comments on how much I appear to know. This is result of a combination of skills and attitude - when I don't know something, I learn it, and what I do know, I improve upon. Is it less about an ideal tester profile, and more about an individual's general attitude? We fall into traps continuously around attempting to define things in IT, and this extends to people, which is illogical. I think it's time to stop trying to profile every damn thing in IT - as a well-qualified tester can also be an appalling one. Testers can be good purely down to attitude - good testers address gaps in their knowledge by filling them, rather than trying to find excuses. Programming and other technical knowledge is unavoidable requirement for testers these days, and that's a good thing.
