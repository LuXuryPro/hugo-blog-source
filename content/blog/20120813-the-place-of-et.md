# The place of ET

Last year, there was some heavy debate around Exploratory testing (ET) - mainly down to increased awareness of it's existence, though those in testing it had been around in many forms since software development begun. It is very difficult to do complete requirements, and while in good Agile fashion, requirements should be continually reviewed and if necessary, edited or added to. Exploratory testing is simply part of that process, not random adhoc testing, which is unfortunately ET had reputation of being. And it can be, in the hands of amateurs. It should be planned and documented, and User Stories should be generated around them. There is no reason testers cannot contribute to user stories. This is a great presentation from Elizabeth Hendrickson which succinctly demonstrates the place of ET, and how it's actually an essential not an optional testing type.
