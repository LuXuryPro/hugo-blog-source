# Why Agile Development?

Here is a short and sweet video on why agile development is better for business - have you ever known a Waterfall project to "delight and surprise"? OK, so the quoted phrase is cheesy and smacks of management-speak. But with agile development, the business has a much better chance of getting what they want, and maybe exceeding expectations. To achieve this is all about managing those expectations. If a client outlines their requirements and then sits patiently waiting for delivery, their expectations will be overly high. Develop in small increments and engage client with review and improvement process, then their perception will change, along with their expectations.
