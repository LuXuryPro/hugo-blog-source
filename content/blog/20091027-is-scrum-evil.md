# Is Scrum Evil?

![scrum1](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/scrum1.jpg)SCRUM was designed with a particular purpose in mind, and it has suffered with too close an association with Agile (which is broader methodology). At best, SCRUM is a sub-Agile method, which assumes all project memebers are dedicated, and in same location.  The Product Owner is CRITCAL component on a SCRUM project.  And this is where SCRUm can go awry - if the project has a Product Owner who is not sufficiently enaged with the project, or lacks skills to make good judgement calls on user stories. ![scrum2](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/scrum2-300x164.jpg)

> Scrum is an Agile development framework that Jeff Sutherland invented at Easel Corporation in 1993. Jeff worked with Ken Schwaber to formalize Scrum at [OOPSLA'95](http://jeffsutherland.com/oopsla/schwaber.html). Together, they extended and enhanced Scrum at many software companies and helped write the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/).
