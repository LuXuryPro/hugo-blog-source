# Duct Tape Development

Unit testing - largely assumed, rarely consistently applied in development today. The main reason behind this, us lack of management over the day to day activities of a development team. They ALL know that continuous build, integration and test are fundamentals of Agile methodologies, and that unit testing is taught at "coding college". The various IDE's can unfortunately mask activity, unless you dig down - and developers assume the only people that go into source control are coders. But for most, thatâ€™s right - Agile can offer various windows on source control.

BBD/TDD provide tests (written in plain English) that directly correlate to requirements. These tests should be updated regular, as they provide the acceptance test (unit test running behind the test script). Viewing and running these tests (with tools such as Finesse) means anyone on project can view and run tests against current requirements. There are no guarantees about how the code is performing the task, but it is a straightforward and simple system - as long as it's maintained! Now watch the army of half-baked coders huff and puff at the audacity of this. Coders are creative people - but there is a job to do, and as much as they can understand the importance of the client, and delivering to requirements, they do not want to be controlled (how they see it) by process. In the last decade there has been more of a "now! now! now!" attitude to delivering projects. Quality can take a back seat to business drivers, and [Duct Tape Programmers](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html) now abound. Short-term thinkers, whose drive it is to complete whatever corners have to be cut, and whatever TESTING needs to be omitted. This is part of moves to shorten the distance between client and product, and coding time and testing is reduce. Now if you are just thinking short-term, you maybe can get away with this. For instance, if your project has a short shelf-life, or a critical start-up company site launch. But code quality is a difficult thing to justify compromising for sake of speed, or corner cutting. 

> At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It's great to rewrite code and make it cleaner and by the third time it'll actually be pretty. But that's not the point-- you're not here to write code; you're here to ship products. --Jamie Zawinkski

This is the kind of language that sales and marketing dissolve into, and this is very telling. That the pressures on developers have amounted to them making statements like this to other developers. Instead of standing their ground, they are simply behaving like the very people we have to push back against some times. They may hold the purse-strings, but they also need a project team vocal enough to voice concerns, and to defend their corner if necessary. Clients not only pay for product, they pay for services of people they expect to know their jobs. Developers are there to write code with objective of delivering a product. The two are not mutually exclusive. It's a dangerous game to play to developers whims, and dare I say it - laziness. TDD and BDD are generally not favoured by developers, as they are forced, by process, to design tests BEFORE they code. They see this a pointless interruption to actual coding. What they don't see is the overall picture, which is although early "admin" increases with task planning, coding time is reduced because the coder has coded direct from the test, which is designed from the user story/scenario. A quality coded, and tested application will be robust, scalable and optimal in code. Employ duct tape programmers at your peril - they will make you happy, and in the long-term they will leave you with something virtually impossible to maintain (duct tape programmers are not keen on documentation either!). I should add, I am prone to duct tape programming - but I don't inflict on a company ;)
