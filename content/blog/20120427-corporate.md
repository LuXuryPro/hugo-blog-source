# Corporate

Asides my student serial-demoing days, and subsequent view of corporate behaviour in the news over the years, what most affected my view of corporations was my earlier contracting experience. And none more so than than huge corporation otherwise known as the Civil Service. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pyhtyoncorporation1.jpg) I started my first contract in 1997, on the atrocious Immigration project in East Croydon. The plan was to remove the old paper-based system, to a state-of-the-art computerised system. They had previously tried a very strange options, using a computerised filing cabinet which took up an entire floor. This system enabled people to be request what they needed via an input terminal, and the relevant filing cabinet would move to you. It was quickly realised that if someone was stuck in the middle of the cabinets somewhere on that floor, they could be crushed as there were no sensors to detect human beings, only other filing cabinets. So millions wasted on a static filing cabinet system. meanwhile near riots were occurring outside every day as tempers frayed in the regular mile+ long queue to the application processing office. The new project was on constant hold when I joined, and there was also an atmosphere in the office you could cut with a knife. Staff had been pushed to the limits, and one of the senior manager committed suicide in first month I was there. Sauntered up through our floor, in the toilets and out the window. Perot Systems (who I was contracting for), were a nice enough company and treated their own staff well. Siemens was given the project, after I have been there 4 months, then charmingly told all the contractors we could take a running jump for all notice pay, and that if anyone wanted to stay, they would be vetted by Siemens. Enter hatchet man (who I would later see, looking a lot older and greyer at BBC Technology), placed in the center of the floor to cause maximum tension. A beligerent and unappraochable man obviously well-tuned to his work. I already decided I wanted out, as I wasn't interested in working for a company with so obviously little respect for existing staff. As one astute Perot staff memeber told me - Perot are people-focussed, whereas Siemens were process-focussed. What does people-focussed mean? I wasn't sure, but I could see the Siemens staff brought in were not the happiest bunch. They had a beleaguered look about them. The whole project and work environment was terrible - there was start-of-the-art scanning equipment for testing, but no testing, because there was a freeze due to major architectural issues (I can't remember specifics). Apart from the wonderful Italian sandwich shop down the road from the office, my memory of that contract has been firmly consigned to waste bin marked "learning experiences". It taught me firstly, that contracts can never be guaranteed, and secondly to never work on a goverment-based contract ever again. Or work for Siemens for that matter. In fact, the main reason I gave notice at BBC technology is because Siemens buyout. The appearance of the hatchet man reinforced that resolve. Siemens are one of these montrosity companies that get bigger by simply buying up other business (whether Siemens will effectively manage them or not). they are very much part of the worst of corporate culture. I avoided these kind of contracts in the future, with the old-fashioned lumbering corporate monstrosities. I had brief foray back into that world, at BOC, where I saw examples of both racist and sexist behaviour. Not an endemic problem with corporation, more a society one. Though this kind of bigotry is common in older corporations (BOC stretches back to Victorian era). A corporation is essentially a portion of society, with many people who would not have otherwise met each other, outside of the work environment. I am not well-suited to corporations, in terms of my attitude, dress-sense, or my work methods. I don't really need a "family-feel" at work, or need my career to be looked after by another. I certainly don't suffer fools gladly. I have always been baffled by the term "permanent work", and failed to understand what security any company could really offer (though it seemed to be a major selling point to prospective employees). Employees in corporate have got so used to being molly-cuddled by their employers, they forget they are adults with self-responsibility. The debates I am hearing now around management remind me that people still need a crutch at work. People are quick to criticise, but generally rather gossip and bitch, rather than initiate change. Employees have families and/or troubles (as I do), but at work they turn into children, spitting the dummy whenever the world is altered. yes, management needs to change away from it's control-based structure. But people need to change too, and stop assuming compnaies are akin to an adult nanny. If you are no good at what you do, and express no interest in switching to something you may be good at, why is that a manager's fault? You can blame the blame-culture, but that is lazy. I see a worse problem - complacency. Whatever problems exist in the workplace, people will tolerate a lot, and in fact resist change (even if current system is acknowledged as bad). Managers are people who have ascended the ranks (rightly or wrongly), so to dehumanize them will serve no purpose. Blame the system? well, partly - a system is controlled and perpetuated by all who reside under it. I am not suggesting a "pitchfork revolution", but all those who point out problems, should realise they are part of it, and passing the buck to management to solve issues is basically keeping everyone in the same unhealthy circles.
