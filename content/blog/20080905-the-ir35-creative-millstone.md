# The IR35 creative millstone

> The High Court has ruled against IT consultancy, Dragonfly Consultancy Ltd, in its IR35 appeal. The case has been closely followed by tax experts and contractors. The Professional Contractors Group (PCG), who funded the appeal, feared that a defeat could undermine much of the successful existing defence or IR35. http://www.shout99.com/contractors/showarticle.pl?id=53666

While Labour have been busy lining their pockets, and returning to their 1970's policies under guise of "New Labour", the Inland Revenue have been losing the plot trying to squeeze money from any vulnerable individuals they can. It is no wonder there are very few english entrepreneurs left, in this culture of supsicion of any one-man bands/small companies. The efforts of the few are funding the folly of this govenrment, and the laziness of a large proportion of english population - a result of the nanny-state, and an over-enthusiastically greedy and deluded government. The population have been dumb enough to vote these conmen back in 3 times. Playing right into their hands, as they know the majority fear a loss of benefits and other free support. What a selfish and self-destructive country we have become, where indolence is rewarded more than effort.
