# Project karma with Kanban

When things go wrong, especially at work, change is preferred over learning from mistakes. By not reviewing what went wrong, you run risk of simply making a bigger hash of it.  A good analogy is when you attempt the nightmare that is flat-pack furniture.   Instructions for these finger-busting items are rarely wholly descriptive or helpful.  So is the problem with the product or the instruction?  Well both usually.  We can't review/improve the instructions - or can we?By spending more time on the instructions, identifying the easier steps and trying to decipher parts with less clarity, we can improve the process of assembly.   So rather than accept the poorly written manual, and grumble as we assemble using our own logic, a more positive step is to review and improve what is there.  This does several things - highlight glaring omissions in instructions, clarify more vaguer areas, and prepare the assembler better for the task in hand.  Waterfall had an inherent issue in that it worked as a "Push System", and many attempts to implement Agile has led to same result. Most of the preparation work was done prior to coding starting, and any change in the plan could cost dearly. Also, the whole push system causes lot of waste associated too much dependency on certain individuals, whilst underusing others. 

![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pushpull.jpg)How best to understand the Push/Pull system in development, is in context of manufacturing. The lightning motif you can see as risk level - and an illustration of fundamentals of both Agile and Lean software development.   Clear from development perspective, but takes a lot more thought in the management.   Scrum loosely adopts this Pull system, but too often it becomes a Push system, purely down to what people are used to.   Instead of smaller tested steps towards goal, you have smaller untested steps until Sprint end.

Assume the Stock boxes are Sprints, the the one on the left represents Sprint start. One the Push system, the user stories/scenarios enter the Sprint Backlog and comprise the contents of Sprint (instantly notice that there is no control here on pace of input).  Features are then developed and continued near end of Sprint, when build/integration/test occurs.  This isn't an Agile Sprint - its a milestone pattern, with no Agile development process.  Now take the Pull system. User stories/scenarios are fed into the Sprint Backlog in more controlled fashion.  Features are developed with sometimes daily build/integration/test cycle.  The cycle continues until Sprint end.  Now this is a milestone of sorts for the business, as this is usually the point when demos are done, and next Sprint plan can be confirmed.  But in terms of development, this is simply the same cycle as has been continuously been in process.  The added advantage is there will be more frequent chances for the business to view the progress of development. Kanban IT is based on Lean principles and Kanban itself has been around for 50 years, and has shown to be successful. Things are seen as a flow without iterations. Not many rules. It's just a focus on reducing work in progress, strict prioritization and limiting demand after capacity. Besides that you have the normal Lean principles of: 

  * Quality
  * Just-in-time (decisions and facts just when they are needed)
  * Short lead-time (quickly from concept to cash),
  * Kaizen (continuous improvement)
  * Minimizing waste (everything that is not adding value to the customer)
Asides the rather shocking omission of testing stage on Kanban task progress board examples, one of the beauties of Kanban is it can be applied not only to Agile, but any methodology you are using - including much maligned Waterfall. Kanban system's "Process Control Focus" suits work with "over 90%" success rate and "Process Improvement Focus" suits work in the area of 50%. The latter is far better suited to software development.   What is commonly omitted when changing process, to review and evaluate the EXISTING process, i.e. the process that currently is not working. It is far easier to get enthused by new ways of doing things, but to approach developing new processes without reviewing and learning from prior mistakes, is a bad start.

Kanban can be used to improve and/or enhance your current processes (yes, even Waterfall). Lean and Kanban can answer the issues with Scrum that many teams face, but they don't require the team to abandon Agile methods. Kanban can be be placed in conjunction with any methodology, but particular well if Agile or Lean approach is taken. Critically, Kanban needs rules, as the art is keeping an optimal balance of feature development with maximised use of skills and resources.  Rules such as how many new tasks can be added at Pending state, or how many features can be in test phase.  It is important to set realistic rules AND remember the important Agile approach of "review and improve".  On the subject raised in the first line, testing is wrapped up too often as acceptance, which is a very broad canvas, and leads to unhealthy situations when unit tested code ends up in the hands of stakeholder. At every stage of task entry to deployment, set rules about how many tasks can be at anyone task. And, just as importantly, ensure individual's backlog also have set limits.  Again, anything can be reviewed and changed.   After a while, you will find that planning is much easier, as long as you have strong people to control flow of requirements and change requests. The beauty of Kanban is it hooks up requirements to tasks in a much more connected way that Scrum does, to development. A Kanban board is an honest picture of project progress.

Scrum didn't fail, what failed was implementation and treating Scrum as methodology when it is (as Agile also is) a framework from which to build your own approach. And chronically, forgetting to make development Agile. A Sprint was never intended to be a Waterfall development schedule, but so easily became one. What is apparent in hindsight is that the language of Agile permeated business and lot faster and longer, than the actual principles it put forward. Lean is more aggressive in it's demands than Agile, and it's not surprising the Lean approach has been taken up (though hesitantly - many still feel burned by Agile!). So take Lean approach to development (what Agile was suggesting, Lean dictates), and embrace the Kanban concept into your planning (which also compounds what Lean dictates, with task planning).
