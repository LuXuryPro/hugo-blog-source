# Where Open Source meets Usability

![](http://www.openusability.org/wordpress/wp-content/themes/openusability/images/openusability_logo.png) A common problem in open source development (though forgivable, given nature of open source), is completeness.  http://www.openusability.org is an effort to redress this from a usability angle at least.  Still early days, but well worth supporting. 

> Getting to a state where it is usable for 'the common computer users' is one of the greatest challenges for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). During the last years, the awareness for usability has significantly increased among FLOSS developers. Still, little knowledge exists about the scope, the methodology and the application of a user-oriented design process. **Changing this is one the major goal of the OpenUsability project.** It provides a platform to bring Open Source developers and usability contributors together. The idea is to establish a long-term relationship between usability and FLOSS development, and to foster the establishment of user-oriented design processes.
