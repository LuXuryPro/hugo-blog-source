# Secure Web Identity

Web Identity has been debated a lot recently, with focus on a the individual user. These debates were generally circular, as the same people who present cases for central single identity, also do not believe in centralised control of data. Also little focus was given to situations where correct data and security are paramount, namely tranasction. ![signasp](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/signasplogo.gif) SignASP is an example of an alternative, but approaching from the business angle, a method for user authentication based on one or many of variety of digital signature for online commerce, legally binding in about 20 countries. Â I believe it is difficult to avoid centralisation of data like this, but there is a good argument for central digital signature that could be used on any ecommerce site, for quick purchasing.Â Identity theft is common, but there is little we can do to prevent it.Â Â If you think it, how many times this year have you used credit, or provided bank details, sent off photocopies of your passport,or birth cirtuficate for verification ....Â These methods are a lot more open to abuse than online indentity theft.
