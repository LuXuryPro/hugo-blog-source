# Business & the Semantic Web

The semantic web could potentially make a lot of web business models redundant. This is good news, and business needed a kick in the seat of the pants, and business has had to re-evaluate how to generate revenue after the intial successes, and increasing general acceptance of web 2.0 (and beyond).  On the back of the obvious youtube/myspace/de.licio.us successes, it appears logically these ventures will components of future ventures.  It feels like business and technology is finally in a proper "marriage" - the question I have is now, will it be business that drives the wwwÂ advancement, and/or vice versa?
