This is something I was hoping Wordpress could manage - a useful service though I tend to use such applications as [Twitpic](http://www.twitpic.com) or [12second.tv](http://www.12second.tv) to post pictures and video with descriptions.Â  But if you thing is blogging "proper" posts on the move, this is a good service with support for many attachment types (image, audio, video and files).
