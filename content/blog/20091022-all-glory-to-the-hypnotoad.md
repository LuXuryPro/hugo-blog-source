# All Glory To The Hypnotoad!

![hypnotoad2](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/hypnotoad2.gif)I would like to congratulate [Nick Griffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Griffin) \- not on his outdated extreme right politics - it was that the whole Question Time debacle showed that: 1\. The UK has become ridiculously overreactive, and in doing so given the BNP more publicity than they could have dreamed of. Deny people speaking rights because you disagree with them is a double standard - what the hell are you afraid of? That he is going to do a [hypnotoad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypnotoad) on the nation? 2\. The BBC still have their heads screwed on - ok, its a ratings winner, but good on them for standing their ground - they are right in their decision. In my opinion ANY recognised politician should be allowed on this programme. 3\. Question Time has potential to be interesting, so I actually have a reason to watch, for the possible entertainment value. I disagree with the BNP stance - the immigration debate deserves ALL angles covered, but to adopt a blanket white-english only approach is plain racist - it is not politics. But in not allowing people the opportunity to express their views, you simply drive extreme-right views underground, where it will become more of a festering boil than you could ever imagine. I think there are more disgusting things going on than this - protesters, why not head up to the Square Mile and cause mayhem up there? That would be far more useful.
