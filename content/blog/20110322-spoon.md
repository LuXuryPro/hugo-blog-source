# Spoon

![Spoon](http://spoon.net/Global/Images/Banner-Logo.png)spoon.net run an extensive service which enables you to run software on your pc, without having to install it, or purchase it. The advantage in testing of course is to be able to use many browser types. This isnt better than something like VMWare (in which you can load various OS/Browser combinations, and the selection of browser versions isnt extensive, but good all round hosted applications tool. Would recommend using if:- 1\. You dont have VMWare or similar Virtualization Software(2) or SAAS capabilities(1). 2\. If you have restricted access on your test PC (some companies are still pretty anal about letting testers install software). Virtualization Software is by far best route, (1) SAAS - Software as a service (SaaS, typically pronounced [s√¶s]), sometimes referred to as "software on demand," is software that is deployed over the internet and/or is deployed to run behind a firewall on a local area network or personal computer. (2) Virtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a hardware platform, operating system, a storage device or network resources.[1]
