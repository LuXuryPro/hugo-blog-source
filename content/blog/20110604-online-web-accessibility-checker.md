# Online Web Accessibility Checker

Keep tabs on your coding quality with this [WCAG tool](http://testwith.us/wcag/checker/index.php). The problem with a lot of online tools for companies, is accessing your test and development sites, from behind proxies. This system can be [downloaded for free](http://www.atutor.ca/achecker/), and is a very easy install process (as long as your server has PHP5 and MySQL).
