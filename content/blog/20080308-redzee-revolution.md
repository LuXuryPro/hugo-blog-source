# RedZee Revolution

Not the most revolutionary search engine in terms of results \- but a unique presentation, which once you use a few times, you will enjoy.  The previews are good enough size to review a site before you visit, and when you open a link,  it opens in a new tabbed page (within the RedZee site.  A good search engine for those that are not so experienced, or for those who want to try something different.
