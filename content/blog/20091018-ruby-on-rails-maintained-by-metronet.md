# Ruby on Rails maintained by Metronet

![ror](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/ror-150x93.png)My recent experience of [Ruby on Rails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) has been negative on several fronts.  Despite adopting a funky image it is a poor pretender of [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_\(solution_stack\)).  It is also one of the languages that attracts developers who dont want to develop - they want everything on a fast track.  This is all well and good when there are no problems, but anyone with an ounce of IT Project experience knows this can never be. As usual, it is QA that has to be the spoilsport to the childrens party - past the excitement of launching websites quickly, comes the pain of maintenance not foreseen due to short-sightedness. I have met RoR developers who dont know what an rss feed is, who dont understand the archtitecture enough to work out the most basic of performance issues.  This is also in fault-zone of RoR - the application server runs at full tilt, whether busy or not - it is so dependant on its libraries that simple changes can prove lengthy and expensive. And the most basic of problems can turn into long dramas. It is a developemnt environnment to get websites off the ground quickly, but fails in the long-term. I doubt it was intended for anything heavy-duty - Twitter [almost collapsed entirely](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/01/twitter-said-to-be-abandoning-ruby-on-rails/) due to its original RoR architecture.  Java is the ONLY way to go for serious high-trafficking site. Much as I am a fan of LAMP, every development shortcut restricts the scalability. As several open source sites show, RoR hasnt really taken off - it comes under heading of "Whats the point?".  Developers who dont want to develop - please save us all time and dont develop!
