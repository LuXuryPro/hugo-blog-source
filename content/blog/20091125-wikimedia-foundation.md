![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Wikimedia_logo_family_complete.svg/250px-Wikimedia_logo_family_complete.svg.png) I love wikipedia, ones of Wikimedia's largest and longest running projects.  It is a truly democratic source of information.  The people who whine about its accuracy amuse me - if people have the passion to be angry, but no passion to do anything about it,  it is singularly unimpressive.  Wikipedia is based on USER CONTRIBIUTION - if you disgaree with something on there, you can contribute with your "truth".  The facts are balanced by usefiul links to other sites of information, or just other opinions. What I have neglected to do in the last 7 years of using it, and using it a lot more in the last year, was bother to find out about them.  I hang my head in shame, as just reading their FAQ site showed me that here truly was a web effort worth supporting actively.  Wikimedia (registered US charity than runs wikipedia) is a non-profit organisation, involved in worldwide charity inititatives. Wikipedia's ultimate goal is to be global source of information, and more importantly democratic in its approach to the data it holds. The most underrated web organisation, along with w3c (world wide web consortium).  These type of organisations are trying to keep the web in way we should hold dear - free and unobstructed access to fundamental information - be it Transformers 2 production history or The Taliban.  Or maybe you should just continue trusting the information from media, governments or some conspiracy theorist. 

> Wikipedia is the world's largest and most popular encyclopedia. It's online, free to use, and free of advertising. Wikipedia contains more than 14 million volunteer-authored articles in over 250 languages, and is visited by more than 330 million people every month, making it the number five most-popular site in the world. It is a collaborative creation that has been added to and edited by millions of people during the past eight years: anyone can edit it, at any time. Wikipedia is the largest collection of shared knowledge in human history, and the people who support it are united by their love of learning, their intellectual curiosity, and their awareness that we know much more together, than any of us does alone.
