# Nothing good was ever fashionable

When the fashion becomes bigger than the substance in tech world, I naturally resist its pull. The substance gets diluted, re-branded, and owned after lengthy patent suits. The same goes for electronic music, for me. After 1994, when the Criminal Justice Bill pushed parties back into commercial clubs, business worked out ways to clone and market it. Much of dance music in underground scene, provided the drum sounds for the drum machines still used today. Music and tech - standing on shoulders of giants, always. Take the wonderful world of the web. The [first online ad](http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/10/1027hotwired-banner-ads/) appeared in 1994. ![1994 first online banner ad](/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/first-banner-adcredit-hotwired.jpg)The first tv advertisement appeared for the internet in 1994 ... [youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znZ1RMdC9Z0[/youtube]  These two events indicated how fast and hard the web was starting to be pushed onto the public, and I mean - pushed. From that very first banner ad, we are deluged with advertising on the web. And most is trying to convince us our lives would be fuller, if we clicked this ad. Much of tech followed suit, realising the money-generating power, of simply generating buzz. Virtually the instant the marketers had their fingers in the web, the phrase "new media" sprung into fashionable tech lexicon - a vague area, but loosely covering on-demand to content anytime and anywhere. Though it took many years to live up to its oversold hype. After working in many Agile and Lean projects, I have come to realise its really the techniques themselves that drive the methodologies. And those principles have existed for decades. Admittedly, people/team management lagged way behind the efficiency of pure tech approaches (incremental development has no concepts of pyramidal power structures). I now have healthy awareness of the same circles that happen with the sale-able methodologies. But one "new" approach rejuvenated my interest in newer development practices, which as you can tell from most posts over last year, is BDD - Behaviour Driven Development. It can be viewed as a strict Lean approach - the stripped-down development/client model.  I like Lean, as I have no time for wallflowers on projects. So why BDD anyway? Implementations vary wildly, but what is missing is any decent case studies - or more to the point, ones of significant scale.  I have said before, BDD is not for the faint-hearted, but it's a client pleaser ultimately, given it UI/UX focused drive.  This means the client has visible measure of results, albeit with occasional mocks and stubs.  It drives development well, because it focuses developers to pass scenarios, rather than complete a set of associated tasks.  It requires a broader developer mindset, and this also applies to the tester.  No room for bluff or preciousness about your area. A true team-oriented approach, and as a result, client-focused.  You can be transparent when you have nothing to hide. While business still mutters about struggling to keep up with their Agile projects, I wonder how they would cope with Lean. If they struggle with concepts such as being engaged with projects they are responsible for, inherently not trusting the team, create pointless reporting gates, and any number of other bad management traits, how could they cope with such transparency in process?  They is a theory that makes total sense. Agile was originally touted as the methodology that put control back in the hands of developers.  What wasn't clear was that in fact, it was about putting control into the hands of people who know what they are doing.  Yes, management need to step it up a bit, and stop expecting Agile and Lean methodologies to perform miracles out of nothing more than a nicely designed Scrum board.  And developers need to learn to listen harder and better.  In QA world, we are used to doing that by default - there are vastly differing opinions on QA, what it is, and where it sits on a project.
