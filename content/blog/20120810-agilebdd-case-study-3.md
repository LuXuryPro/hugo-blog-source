# Agile/BDD Case Study

Agile is an overused term, and very rarely applied correctly. For instance, the most common dnager is in assumption that all developers are Agile.  This stems from fact that most of the modern methodologies were driven by the development world. One of the more odd flipsides of using offshore testing resource is that you end up reviewing what they have done - just to be sure. If the offshore team is providing development and testing service then the picture can become very muddy, unless there is transparency in process.  An external company is far less likely to stick their hand up and say they are struggling with a bit of work. One of the more tragic elements of this particular project was the effort made using BBD to develop feature files.  The problem was the development did not follow the principle, in spite of promoting the methodology and tools. So though feature files were kept up to date, the connected tests werent.  Developers simply used the feature files for reference and simply plodded on in non-unit testing fashion.  the administration of BDD can seem daunting to a developer, but one you have sold up to a methodology it is sensible for all to keep to it.  Depending on the company, these kind of mistakes can carry on for a long time before someone takes decision to change things, painful though it may be. Because the offshore company failed to observe BDD fully, development soon went off-track. But instead of addressing the problem in a Agile review/improve fashion, more and more coding was done to paste over the cracks. The project quickly dissolved into a Waterfall project which necessitated full regression testing with every release. 

> Customers must get involved for Agile to work

In Scrum it’s the Product Owner, and it must be the single wringable neck – the person accountable to the business for the project’s delivery of real value. It is the person who not only understands, but can make decisions about functionality, business needs and the user interface.
