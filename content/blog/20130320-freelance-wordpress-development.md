# Freelance WordPress development

There are many cheap solutions to getting a website up and running.  So why bother investing a little more time effort and money into a professionally designed WordPress website?  Well, it's all about whether you need to think short-term or long term. Websites are like anything else in life - they need care and attention, otherwise the quality rapidly goes downhill. The way many of these cheap services work is to constrict the customer in what they can do, to keep support at a minimum.  You may find you are also beholden to third parties you are unaware off, as the larger website services such as wix, are resellers for domain sellers, email hosting, etc.   There is nothing wrong with this inherently, as they are aiming to service and large market, efficiently. Website development in the freelancer market is woefully underestimated as people have a mentality of a 100% finished, self-maintaining product. It is hard to explain to your average person about agile development  and the benefits of having an efficient database.  So you end up with a shield, to protect them from the technical nuances.  But right there, you have sold yourself cheap, because if you cannot justify the benefits of all that in under the hood of a website, justifying costs becomes a little difficult. ![Dealing with scope creep](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/6982019596_aae5e0efe2.jpg) The point to get across to clients is that in order for websites to last, and to get your wonderfully made website to work for you, they have to put in effort. If you leave the client out of the process, "scope creep" is common result.  Because the client feels detached from the process, the only view they have is the front-end website so their only focus is how it looks. There is a lot we can do as developers to ease some of this work.  Be it blogging tools, adding slideshows, social network login/registration, memberships systems.  WordPress makes this part easy for developers.  And for the client too, but there is no getting round the fact there is some learning for them to do too.  They cannot be handheld forever. So as well as the cost of a website, training is mandatory, as you cannot expect everyone to plough through unfriendly user manuals to learn how to do it.  Most of WordPress they won't even touch, so why distract or confuse unnecessarily? So how to sell a WordPress website options effectively is to focus on anything but the actual website itself.  The content management system is where the site is managed, and it is not a good idea to suddenly present that after the website is finished.  It's an Agile approach - engage the client early, get them on the CMS, and they will not only learn as they go, their requirements will get clearer and more relevant.  Given the non-political nature of freelance web development, can apply Agile approaches to smaller project, and see positive results very quickly.  After all, we all want to be taken seriously.
