# Operation Chokehold is coming

![](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2009/12/choke-1260879777.png)Christ, spare us all from whining iPhoners!  Interesting (but I am sure random) choice of picture, putting iPhone users in role of  evil Darth vader, and AT&T in role of lowly Empire "cannon fodder".   I read this article, then read the associated stories and thought - well that makes total sense. Bandwidth is not unlimited, whatever mobile broadband sales/marketing says.  If you think about it, how can it be?  And the millions of Nathan barley iPhone users are clogging up the airwaves with trite shallow data.  So I say f*ck 'em, and go for it AT&T - iPhone users want to try and bring the mobile network down?  Get a life and protest against something that actually matters - this is just shallow, but in keeping with the average iPhone user profile.
