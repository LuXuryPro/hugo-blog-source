# User Experience

_Testing Using Psychology, Emotion & Semantic Principles_ The User Experience is more than usability, it crosses into area of user profiling - user behaviour based on your target audience.   We evaluate from real user perspective, in controlled testing approach. 

  * Will the user get the point of the page?
  * Can user understand the navigation system?
  * Can user guess where to find things?
  * How do users interact with the web site you are testing?
  * What is difficult for people to do?
  * Where do they get lost?
  * What makes sense to them?
  * What makes them feel distrustful or insecure?
  * What do they like and what do they hate?
  * Can the user accomplish a key task?
  * Can the user find something specific?
