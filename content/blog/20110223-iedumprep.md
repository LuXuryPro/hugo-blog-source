# IE=DUMPREP

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/ms_ie_html5_table-170x170.png)IE, a favourite generator of [dumprep](http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2008/03/04/what-is-dumprepexe-why-is-kernelfaultcheck-dumprep-0-k-in-msconfig-startup/) files, is skipping over the fact IE8 is a pile of coding crap, and giving both coders and testers pointless headaches. As with Vista, IE8 suffered from a chronic lack of testing. Something so important as a browser should not be released in half-baked state, expecting the users to help MS with work they should have done. Now Internet Explorer 9 is on horizon, and looking no more positive. The table attached is Micorosofts own report on IE9 support compared with other browsers (REF: [Mozilla: Internet Explorer 9 is not a modern browser](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/15/mozilla_on_ie9/)). This is based not on standards checks, but their own internal tests. On the basis of IE7 and IE8, I wouldnt put much trust in their own internal QA Useful Info: [Compatibility tables for support of HTML5, CSS3, SVG and more in desktop and mobile browsers]()
