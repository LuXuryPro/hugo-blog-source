# About | PhweetTalk

![](http://static.phweet.com/images/phweetbeta.png)  


Phweet lets you accept calls with one click from your Twitter page or Twitter clients. Phweet is a simple service where you donâ€™t need to download or share anything more to talk. The call is contained within a PhweetUrl; a smart link that calls you. And you can share who you are talking to in real time without having to reveal or exchange phone numbers or other identities.
