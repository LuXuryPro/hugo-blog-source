# Everyone's a critic ...

Waterfall ... much maligned, and earned it's label and reputation post-Agile. In QA, we know how easy it can be to slate anything in technology. In fact, being a critic is an easy position to be in, as the onus is not on the critic to provide a solution. The evolution of Agile did not happen on the back on Waterfall criticism - it was simply a move to provide alternative to the methodologies available at the time, that did not suit the demands of modern development.  When an Agile project fails, a common and dangerous immediate assumption is that it is Agile itself that has failed. That somehow Agile processes are at fault. This can never be the case, as if a project is truly working Agile, then the problems that caused a project to fail would have been highlighted earlier in the continual review and improve cycle of project process. Which leads me neatly onto to where this problem most commonly arises - a place where climbing the career ladder or maintaining a cushy role are common objectives. Where people will watch and wait for a project to fail, before stepping in to "fix it". Corporations - the last bastion of 20th century company structure that is long past it's sell-by date. Generators and wasters of huge amounts of money, in equal measures. And a place where no-one cares that much about the company overall.

But unfortunately still endemic issue within corporations (and other larger companies). This is main reason why corporations are having a hard time implementing Agile on their projects.
