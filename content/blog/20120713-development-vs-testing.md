# Development vs Testing

You have rapid software testing, context-driven testing, agile testing ... is there really any need to define what testing is about to such levels of instructional detail? Or is the fact of the matter is that testing is not such an isolated activity that warrants this? Development and testing have always been irrevocably tied together - and are merging even closer with every advance in automated testing tools. You cannot have developers following one approach, then testing taking a different approach. We can retreat to our ivory towers, this perpetuates the historical disparity between business and development. Testing always performed an effective bridge between the two. Disengagement between development and testing process leads to blinkered approach. If ever there was a good reminder of how much testing is driven by development approach, it's when testing on a hardcoded solution - uncommon these days, granted.  This situation does happen outside of college projects, usually because there is no choice (as result of hastily agreed delivery date, for example), or in even worse scenario, because it is perceived as a quicker way to deliver.  It's a rarity (thankfully).  The problem ,behind this approach is not in the short-term, it exposes the project to more risk the more it progresses. Simple changes end up necessitating entire regression test. Yes, I do feel like I have gone back in time - but the difference is regression testing on step-down projects wasn't a daily (or even weekly) activity. Testing in this scenario is forced to adopt a continual regression test approach. So all your pretty little testing-specific ideas go out the window. This reminds when testing was simply a stage at the end. And the volume of work was detailed to nth degree. Bad days. Let's not go there again. There is room for context-driven testing and rapid software testing, as the traditional ISEB/ITIL qualifications are woefully short on real-life usefulness, embedded as they are in the old-fashioned "regurgitation" examination process. Pragmatic IT courses are infinitely more useful. But in the current race to embrace testing as a proper profession, we have to be mindful that the direction we should be going is development. Indeed I firmly believe that testers will be the programmers of the future.
