# Ascii fun

![2ch-aa](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/2ch-aa-150x73.png)I have long had a fascination with Ascii art and people are still taking to new levels - from [the entire Matrix movie](http://onyx.chattanoogastate.edu/~jack/matrix/) rendered in ascii character, to the use of japanese ascii (as in picture to left). There is are still growing number of applications evolving - check out the [Ascii Stereogram **Image** Generator](AsciiStereo.php) and the [Ascii **Signature** Generator](AsciiSignature.php).
