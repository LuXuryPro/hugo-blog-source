# Put your trust in us ...

People put their trust in consultancies too far - a consultancy will always (good or bad) be happy to tell you where you are going wrong - and that they are the solution. It leads to a lot of mistakes made at senior level - recent memory is of an IT Director at a publishing company slating his project managers, in front of a testing consultancy under evaluation. Not only disrespectful, but stupid behaviour. I like to think I do things differently - I am out there to make money, but also to build upon my (I hope!) trustworthy reputation. I dont believe business means you have a legitimate reason to act akin to a conman. And the damage senior management can do in not retaining any loyalty to their own staff when dealing with them.
