# Oh the sad pettiness of website owners ...

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/03/spam-170x170.jpg)Oh the sad pettiness of website ownersÂ who get a bad review - are you teenagers? Maybe you should just blub in your pillow about that awful man who slated your service in his grumpy-old-man blog. Using email attacks is a very common method, but any half-decent spam program will deal with this crap. Re-invent the wheel if you must, with no added value apart, from building a business for yourself - but expect some flak for it, or go back to the playground :)
