# QA Management on gaming projects

I have worked on online MMORPG gaming projects, in capacity of QA Manager. Though my focus was on international localization projects, I was able to apply more traditional QA processes successfully to the projects as a whole. Gaming projects, as a rule, rely on a more closed development environment, with testing limited to plain gameplay. While sufficient, I believe this approach restricts possibilities beyond the actual game. For the MMORPG developments I have seen, no real allowance was made for possible interest from external companies, or been prepared in a state for localization. In my QA capacity, these possibilites were obvious. I realise there are not too many QA managers out there with this kind of experience on gaming projects, but if there are, I would love to hear your experiences, especially if you managed to extend a game's commerical viability using QA processes.
