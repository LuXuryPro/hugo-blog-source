# Bluehoo – friends you bever knew you wanted

![bloohoo](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2008/12/bloohoo-150x127.png) Up to now my only experience of bluetooth, outside of file transfer or wifi, was fending off numerous virus attempts.  I am sure there have been efforts before, but found this little app for social networking using bluetooth.  A simple enough service - just download software to your (probably already burgeoning!) mobile, and then you are enabled you to communicate with other Bluehoo users. My biggest bugbear with these type of ideas is in order for it to work, everyone has to download the software.  Does this then preclude me from other mobile social networks, purely the software doesnt work that way?  As usual social networking applications are anything but - the "walled garden" approach to social networking is sadly still prevalent. Surely applications that are portable and flexible are way forward.
