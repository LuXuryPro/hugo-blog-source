# Captain of Testing @ Birdseye

I went to meet with BSI today, to discuss supplying test services for their new CMS for publishing/collaboration.  On route, a recruitment agent called me up about some consultancy work in Holland.  "What you going for today?" he asked, as any decent agent would ask.  I usually give my prepared speech on confidentiality, but occasionally I just make up a name or choose another company that comes into my head at the time.  This time, for some reason, it was "Birds Eye"!  Not sure where that came from.  Anyway, just as I approached BSI, another agent called telling me there was a hot contract for test management consultancy at Birdseye - she carried on in false veiled secrecy about how this was hot off the press, and had any other agencies been in contact.  I stifled my laughing, before telling her I was interested.

After the interview I then received a voicemail from my partner, with a message from another agency, also about a Test Manager role at Birdseye.  Either a big coincidence, or more than likely, hghlighting one of the ways recruitment consultants work - i.e. for "we have this client ..." read "we heard about this job, and we are collecting cvs to sell ourselves to the company".  All valid sales techniques, so no criticism there - just amusing to be the cause of such a flurry of excitement for a few agencies.
