# New development generation

I see mashup projects as a new stage of development, also opening up development to people who would not normally code. Public web API's, open source and social networking are a big part of this.Â This is welcome evolution of development,Â and though still in an infancy phase, it is an increasingly viable methodology for business-driven projects.Â I am interested to hear of experiences with successful commercially-driven mashup projects.Â Â 

> jaffamonkey was started on a mashup project in 1999, though it had label as yet.Â Web Radio in its infancy was an expensive endeavour, so a flexible and cooperative approach was needed to get a viable audio streaming system up and running.Â Not financially remunerative, but enjoyable and a great learning experience.Â Sometimes it is not all about the revenue.
