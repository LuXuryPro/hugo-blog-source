# TamperData

Oh, I like this - a great tool for any web tester, and a better alternative to using CURL to manipulate POST/GET http data. TamperData is an Firefox extension to track and modify http/https requests. It is ideal to common more lightweight security issues, which are important to consider, given the amount of amateur hackers, and the software available to them. As an aside, if you want a serious stab at (snigger!) penetration testing, try the [Backtrack](http://www.backtrack-linux.org/) linux distro. Use a few tools on this and, believe me, you will never do anything that requires security, across a wireless network.
