# GIMPshop.com - A GIMP hack

![](http://www.gimpshop.com/doggy.gif)[GIMPshop.com - A GIMP hack by Scott Moschella](http://www.gimpshop.com/) GIMPshop is a modification of the free/open source GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), intended to replicate the feel of Adobe Photoshop. Its primary purpose is to make users of Photoshop feel comfortable using GIMP. As someone who only uses image programs for quick resizes, and edits, I always found Photoshop a bit clunky and feature-heavy.  Gimp has been a favourite of mine for many years, offering more useful features than an MSPaint level program, but not as processor-hungry as the full-blown graphics applications.  This modification is a great idea to broaden the audience for Gimp (surely started as a joke name!).
