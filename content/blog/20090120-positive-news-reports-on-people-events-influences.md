# Positive News - Reports on People, Events & Influences

![](http://www.positivenews.org.uk/Positive_News_images/adverts/current_issue.gif) A nice change for those of us sick of tabloid sensationalism of doom and gloom.Â  I know as a nation we are a tad on the pessimistic side, but if all we had to go by was British media, we would all be queuing at [suicide booths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_booth). Its a good reminder, amongst all the grime of constant wars and greedy bankers, that there is actually good things going on too!
