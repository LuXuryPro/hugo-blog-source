# Rubber Duck Methodology

[caption id="attachment_1879" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="Rubber Duck"]![Rubber Duck](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/uploads/duck-150x150.jpg)[/caption] 1) Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety) 2) Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that's all right. 3) Explain to the duck what you code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain things line by line 4) At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way. _In summary ask yourself a question, before asking someone else, as you may get the answer just by formulating a question in your head._ <http://lists.ethernal.org/oldarchives/cantlug-0211/msg00174.html>
