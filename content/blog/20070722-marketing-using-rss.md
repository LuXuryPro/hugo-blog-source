# Marketing using RSS

![ploud](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/ploud-logo.png) This is a good marketing use of rss syndication. Spam and viral marketing campaigns have had a good run, and no doubt done the job intended (at least, I assume they have done to their intended audience). Though people are generally heistant about providing their email addresses, without valid reason. And recieving unsolicited email will only ultimately to damage to a company's reputation, RSS feeds are seen an innocuous, and generally people will subscribe without question. The real beauty of this is that people will only subscribe to feeds that are of actual interest which means the target audience is largely relevant.
