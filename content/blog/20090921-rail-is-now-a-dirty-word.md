# "Rail" is now a dirty word

![dev](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/09/dev-150x125.png)I myself think that these days, there is no right or wrong development language - it is the best tool for best job.  For example, I know PHP is not the most efficient or secure of languages, but I am familiar with it, and like its flexibility and speed of development.   Where is all goes wrong is when people try to make something bigger than it deserves.  The unscalable heap of hype that is Ruby-on-Rails is good example - usually development speed is proportionally sacrificed with application server performance. RoR excels in this - many a company have been sucked into the expensive maintenance nightmare that is RoR.  Great for startups/enthusiasts/small websites - but can be a killer on long-term projects.  Hype should never surround a development language, it is too fundamental to be creating illusions around.  But doesnt stop some people ... This leads me to Railo, an offering from the Cold Fusion camp, usually synonymous with walled-garden approach.  Asides the rather sad name (using "Rail" is title is a little transparent effort to appear current and trendy), Railo is a pointless attempt to "join in" with the fast moving web development world (though hard to understand their intention from the website). The [wikipedia definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railo) is a good one  -as it also highlights its pointlessness .... 

> **Railo** is a compiler for translating and executing of [CFML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language)-based websites. The compiler translates the [CFML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) code into [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\)) classes which can be executed on a Java server. Railo also comes with a runtime engine, which contains all necessary libraries for the translated code. Railo automatically detects when to translate a CFM file or when to use the runtime engine. Railo compares best with [JSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages). JSP uses different syntax but the main functionality is almost the same. Because Railo implements most of the JSP interfaces, it is highly compatible with JSP

Railo seems to be exclusively for exisiting ColdFusion who probably feel they are out of step with the rest of the web development world - but the approach is bizarre, trying to appeal to all developers.   What I do resent is when someone is just trying to reivent the same wheel, then try and convince the rest of us their's is better.  Yes, Java is good - but its not as good without Cold Fusion.  And etc for any web development language you care to name .  Give me a break!    It may be good, it may be bad - the point is I just dont care.  Cold Fusion always suffered from its walled garden approach, and Railo is a too-late effort to address its weaknesses. What I care about a development language are five things:- 

  * How much does it cost to develop?
  * Is it scalable?
  * Is it secure?
  * Is it easy to maintain code?
  * Is the hype honest?
Ruby on Rails fails on all 5, in my opinion.  Railo I dont know enough about, but I know enough to recognise when someone is trying to reinvent the wheel, or just trying to "fit in".  Another favourite example of misguided attempt to update a programming  language, is the DB crunching [COBOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL),  I love for its simplicty and clarity of purpose. In the early 1990's, Visual Object COBOL was proposed, which went against its very premise as [procedural language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_language), not [object-oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).  In other words, it was no longer COBOL.  It was not suprisingly unsuccessful, as it is not the place of a development language to grow outside of its methodology - at that point it ceases to be the same thing - and makes its purpose vague.
