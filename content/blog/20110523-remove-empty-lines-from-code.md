# Remove empty lines from code

One of the more annoying tidy-up jobs is additional linespaces which few editors support, so I gladly found this javascript snippet which does exactly that. And nothing else - there are online tools that claim to do complete tidy, but from experience, it appears to approach these code tidy exercises seperately. Simply enter text below to see. A good example of why I needed this was I copied the html from my Linkedin profile, only to be presented by what seemed like 100's of superfluous empty lines. This online tool will remove/delete all empty/blank lines/rows within your text/list.  **NOTE:** Javascript must be enabled.  Just copy and paste your text in here and click "Remove empty lines" button.  
  
Enter your text here and click the "Remove Empty Lines" button above. To test, just click the "Remove Empty Lines" button and watch these blank lines between this text disappear!
