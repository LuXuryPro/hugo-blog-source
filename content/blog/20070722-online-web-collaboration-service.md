# Online Web Collaboration Service

Web conferencing at the best of times is a headache if you try to do it within a company infrastructure. I have seen many attempts fail, due to the constrictive nature of company firewalls and routers. Although certain messger clients already provide a web conferencing, reliability from inside a company network is again unpredictable. Vyew provides a nice online service, which features a very intuative UI, and many features. There is a free signup option (though you would have ads, but not intrusive), which is perfect for a tryout.
