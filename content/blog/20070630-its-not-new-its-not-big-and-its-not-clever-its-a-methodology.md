# It's not new, it's not big, and it's not clever, its a methodology

> Agility in Software Development Circles is defined as â€œMethods and practices that embrace changeâ€ (The Agile Alliance 2001). Agile methods are lightweight and all Agile Methods share similarities. These similarities are: 
> 
>   * Individuals and iterations are preferred over processes and tools
>   * Working software over comprehensive documentation
>   * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>   * Responding to change over following a plan. (The Agile Alliance 2001)
> The core concepts include: 
>   * Different projects need different processes or methodologies
>   * Focusing on skills, communication, and community allows the project to be more effective and more agile than focusing on processes (Cockburn, 2001).
