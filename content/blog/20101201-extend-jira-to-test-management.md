# Extend JIRA to test management

Simple but effective - store your test scripts on JIRA, then process them like any other issue. The main advantage is though JIRA not designed for storing test scripts, the powerful issue linking features. 1\. Create New Project 2\. Create New Issue Type of Test Script. 3\. Ensure only relevant fields associated with Issue type. 4\. Use Link functionality to link a script to one or more issues. You can customise JIRA workflow by taking a copy of the default workflow, associating it with your test scripts project, and edit it. Or simply follow the same default workflow (resolving for test completion, then re-opening if required to re-run).  **Test Automation** Using the Bamboo plugin with Selemium RC enables further extending JIRA into automated testing.

Continuous integration (CI) brings faster feedback to your development process, preventing bugs from piling up and reducing the risk of project delays. Bamboo enables development teams of any size to adopt CI in minutes, easily integrate it with their work day and scale their build farm using elastic resources in the Amazon EC2 cloud.
