# Hunt the Postbox

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150" caption="Free Our Data"]![Free Our Data](http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/freeourdata.gif)[/caption] [Do you know where your postboxes are?](http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/blog/?p=503) Wonderful!  The Post Office are obstructing our information on where Postboxes are, by refusing to list their locations - their techniques at delivering bad service has reached level of an actual recognisable business approach.  And in keeping with turning Post Offices into some kind of Orwellian human cesspit. I always feel I am travelling to different parallel dimension.  The banks are always following the "confuse the customer" appraoch, newer confusing layouts which give appearance of futuristic banking, without provising anyone who can help you beyond taking money out and putting money in.  In the words of Roy from the [IT Crowd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd), "What a bunch of b*stards!".
