# Mobile Web Accessibility Assessment

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/mobileOK-125x125.png)I found this [Mobile Web Accessibility Assessment Tool](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobilewaat/) which is proving to be a real gem. Based around core w3c standards arround mobile and web accessibility standards, this java app presents a clear UI with dizzying array of options, from disability types and persona's, to multiple WCAG2 standards. 

> MobileWaaT provides accessibility evaluation of mobile web applications by applying the Mobile Web Best Practices (Mobile Web Initiative) as well as the WCAG2.0 guidelines (WAI Initative) into mobile-adequate contents (e.g., iPhone, Android, etc.). 

A very useful mobile web accessibility tool - in terms of coding standards these two validation areas go argely hand in hand. Despite constant harping on projects, observing basic coding standards can save a lot of headaches. Rules are sometimes made to be broken, but in coding, rules should only be bending. So all your senses are working well - good for you. But there is a alrge section of your users for whom that isn't true. Ignore them at your peril. Though the w3 validators are great tools, found this piece of open source which not only does extensive checks coverinng A -AAA standards, but also personas. personas are an extension of usability principles. In identifying a target audience, you target a myriad of different personalities, intellingence and abilities. By using personas, you can capture more realistic testing, and will give you competitive edge in your area of business. Well designed sites get marketed by themesleves by recommednation. If a partially sighted person finds a sight that makes their lives easier, they are highly likely to recommend it around their network.
