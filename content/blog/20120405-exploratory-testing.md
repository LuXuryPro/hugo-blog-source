# Exploratory Testing

![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/out-of-scope-300x222.jpg)Exploratory Testing (ET) has somehow become a specific "type of testing", when I (and many others) had always used it as part of general testing approach (i.e. an enhancement). Agile and Lean methodologies encourage ET as default, as it's very given to the whole "Review & Improve" ethos. But ET has a longer history, dating back to the first recorded formal definition in 1983 by Cem Kaner. Requirements are key linchpin for testing scope, but I am more used to environments that expect testers to think "outside the box" and not wait to be told or prompted. And some companies just plain won't know what to ask for apart from "just make sure it works". I am cautious of these explicit divisions of testing types, as it could indirectly lead to "well, you never asked me to do exploratory testing, did you?" type scenarios. Testing a form field with illegal characters may fall under ET, but who wouldn't want that covered anyway (requirement or no requirement). More ET education needed, granted. To make ET (or "common sense testing") a specific type of testing type, I am not so sure of. The biggest fear from the business, is that ET is off track, and ultimately worthless test efforts, and it is down to testers to justify what they are doing. Let's take the current definition by Cem Kaner (accepted as the originator of the term back in 1983) ... 

> a style of software testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel throughout the project. http://kaner.com

So in other words ... know your job. If you have been working in testing for a number of years, you will know ET is supposed to happen anyway. ET wasn't formalized as it's own testing-type entity, it was part of the overall test approach. Testers are there to ensure requirements are met and the code works, but testers are also there to question requirements and scope - the client and project manager can't be expected to think of everything during planning phases. What is important is to make sure all testing activity is reported in right way, and that ET doesn't become "Ad-hoc" activity - it should be ingrained in your overall approach to testing.
