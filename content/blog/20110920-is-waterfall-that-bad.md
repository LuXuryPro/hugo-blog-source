# Is Waterfall that bad?

![Waterfall](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/09/shutterstock_83488540.jpg)Was Waterfall as bad it is perceived to be? Whilst the approach is not geared towards every project, dismissing entirely is an arrogance. When soemthing new and improved arrives, it is generally given a holy grail sell-job - to extent where anything previously is portrayed as redundant. What hasn't changed too much is coding and requirements. No methodology radically changed anything in these areas, as they both NATURALLY adapt to project demands, assuming a strong project manager. 

> “[Waterscrum] refers to the notion of using Scrum as a process in an organization that uses waterfall-based checkpoints to manage risk.”

When I first heard the term "Waterscrum", I dug a little deeper, and it is bigger concept than just a piss-take (though who knows, maybe that's how it started). Waterscrum tends to happen by accident, when SCRUM (the most popular and understood of the Agile methodologies) clashes with Waterfall die-hards. This is largely down to a company hierarchy, and the demands of those upstairs is measure by milestones, not Sprints. You will never get the ideal amount of engagement from the stakeholder in a corporation, as you would do in a creative agency. Dedicated resources rarely occur in corporations. The question it raises is can you have both? Exactly how to do it. Everyone has heard throwing the baby out with the bath water. These Agile methodologies are largely aimed are development, around the Software Development Life Cycle. So why not keep it there, instead of pretending something radically new has happened with requirements (beyond reformatting into user stories). Waterfall had business analysts, Agile has Product Owner. Waterfall has project manager, Agile has Product Owner/Scrummaster filling this role. Waterfall has a Test Manager, Agile has ..... major oversight. Manual/Automated Testers in Agile fit in only as functions. Some try to bypass that "hurdle" all together and allow their control freak development team dictate. We in testing had to define that part ourselves, which led me to more current roles akin to QA Manager. Anyway, a little off the point for this post. Agile promotes a philosophy, then capitalism ensured that philosophy became tangible and saleable. In the course of that effort came the marketing, and the Agile Manifesto becoming like a biblical text - open to translation. I am sure there are some people who specialise in Agile-specific services are genuinely good - regardless of the methodology. But there are many amateurs, who have seized on another buzz-word frenzy to captilise of companies paranoia they are somehow missing out. When Agile entered the corps, then the cracks really started to show. Startups and smaller companies tend to communicate frequently by default, and the environment is already a SCRUm dream setup. Try and apply in a larger company - you can strategise, plan and distribute your goals. But then who going to push it forward - police it, for want of better phrase. It could be completely against your current work culture.
