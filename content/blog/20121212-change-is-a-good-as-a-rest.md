# Change is a good as a rest

Though still happy in my field of Quality Assurance, I have decided to use my skills in other areas, building a [Wordpress website design and hosting service](http://dreamkunst.com). Assisting me in this venture is prolific web designer and artist, [Claudia Feigk](http://www.claudiafeigk.com/).  WordPress has long been a favourite of mine, and I have done extensive development and integration work on various WordPress projects. I have always made efforts to improve technical and programming skills, so WordPress seemed a natural choice as basis for a business idea. We are a start-up with several pieces of work in pipeline, and a couple deployed.  What you can be assured with is that our pricing model is very fair, as we follow an approach of using open source, so what you paying for is development time.  This makes the whole process a lot clearer for the client.  They are paying for a product by skills.  This frees them up to take any future options they want regards further development and support. Established open source provides great platforms to develop products.
