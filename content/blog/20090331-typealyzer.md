![entp](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/entp-150x150.gif)This is a project dedicated to the research about how the language reflects our psychological type, and thus our motivations and interests. The fundamental idea is that everyone of us use different _personas_ or social roles at different moments. The major research aim of this project is to find and describe patterns in what interests different _personas_ in terms of opinions, brands, media content etc. [Typealyzer](http://www.typealyzer.com/)
