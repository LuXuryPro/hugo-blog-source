# Keep ISEB Out Of Testing

The flow incompetent ISEB testers seems to have stemmed now, which is good news.   BBC lost a lot of testers, through its bizarre ISEB/Nigerian hiring policy - a stream of  unskilled testers, made skilled by a little certificate.  "Yes, you can barely communicate to developers or managers, understand little about the web, work slowly and inefficiently, but hey - you have an ISEB, you must be special".   But then the beeb were never the sharpest tool in the box, when it came to software  development.   Looking round the forums relating to ISEB, it is seen as some kind of holy grail to enter the IT contracting market.  Testing is not just testing - a tester who just understands testing principles (as ISEB see fit) with no other skills, is no tester at all.  Gradually there is realisation that all ISEB has done is reduced quality, not improved it.  It provided an easy platform for anyone to slip in through the back door, on the back of a 40 multiple choice exam, that can be taken as many times as you like.  And a lot of the examination centres are a joke - the one I took mine in, I was left totally unsupervised for the entire time. I actually had to go and find someone, because got tired of waiting after I finished.   When you look for a tester, dont just look at the ISEB and set your mind in a mode of  "I dont have to think anymore".  Testers can qualify for ISEB,  and barely be able to string a sentence together in a bug report.  That no exaggeration - I have seen it, and sacked it.
