# Irrational fear of documentation

The subject of project issues documentation (be it bug, tasks, features, improvements) usually generates overreactions to sensible QA audit approach. Â  Issue tracking systems are is not intended as replacement for communication, but I have lost count of the number of times when an issue is regressed, you get blank looks as to how it was fixed last time. And why? Because no-one recorded the information anywhere. Bothering developers every time you find a bug is not sensible - it is only of value if you have genuine query. Whether you have a conversation or not, results should be recorded, even if it seems irrelevant at that time. To do otherwise belies an inability to think forward, only in the now. ![Issue Tracking](http://www.expertprogrammanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Issue-Management-Process.jpg) Keeping a good issue management system should also be backed by good workflow principles. Of course, sounding out developers prior to issue raising is good idea, but the assumption is that the tester is competent enough to raise good clear issues. Your article seems based on assumption that the tester could be anyone, not someone with testing skills. Whether or not an issue can be reproduced is neither here no there - there is value recording it and following process. If these "unreproducible" issues surface again, and you haven't bothered recording the detail, then there is no history to help you or the developer. This is the old mistake of thinking that ALL documentation is useless - Agile principle is to minimise unnecessary documentation, but issue history should not be included in that. This article makes little pragmatic sense, as issue management and tracking is sensible approach to recording project history. Maybe the issue system you have been using isn't very good(?). But I think resistance to formal issue management is largely down to peoples resistance to doing "boring" documentation. As someone who has worked 7 years in Agile/SCRUM environments (do varying degrees), it is clear some people use the methodology to hide behind when justifying lack of documentation. An issue management system is very much part of the daily SCRUM process, and the more information it has, the more people refer to it. Another good justification of thorough issue management is the poor testing sap that follows behind you when you leave! Give them a break, heh? ;)
