The reason sleep has been a memory ;) but nothing like a baby to get you evaluating whats important, and where you are going in life. Keeping it together with exercise, and not losing sight of long-term dreams - that's my way anyhow. He arrived in the world 7 weeks earlier, and 3 months on all the early drama seems a long time ago. But that would make sense, as days with babies and children are always seem a lot longer to them - a day is an eternity. So I curse sometimes how the work week seems to be longer and drawn out, then I remember why - i am trapped in a baby's timezone, which is not so bad a place to be :)
