# About XMPP

![](http://www.xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png) The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open XML technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, media session management, shared editing, whiteboarding, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized XML routing. The core technology was invented by [Jeremie Miller](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/people/jer.shtml) in 1998, refined in the [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) open-source community in 1999 and 2000, and formalized by the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) in 2002 and 2003, resulting in publication of the [XMPP RFCs](http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/) in 2004. Although the core technology is stable, the XMPP community continues to define various [XMPP extensions](http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/) through an open standards process run by the [XMPP Standards Foundation](http://www.xmpp.org/xsf/). There is also an active community of open-source and commercial developers based at [jabber.org](http://www.jabber.org/).
