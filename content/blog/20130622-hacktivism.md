# Hacktivism

> I would caution anyone, and everyone, to not judge anybody by information that isn’t complete, over the Internet especially, and when all the facts aren’t known. [Anonymous justice is no justice](http://www.calgaryherald.com/opinion/editorials/Editorial+Anonymous+justice+justice/8511398/story.html)

DDoS (distributed denial of service) is one of the major ways groups like Anonymous use for protest, and there are rather [dumb calls to make DDoS legitimate form of protest](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/22/paypal-wikileaks-protesters-ddos-free-speech). The DDoS scattergun approach affects more people than the actual target. They are largely a self-promotion exercise, and never have any lasting value. While the authorities generally overreact to the actions of rather stupid young men, it is indicative of the amoral individualism amongst hacker communities.  The delusion that simply breaking something, is somehow in itself a revolutionary act, and worthy of applause. DDoS is amateur hacker territory, where anyone with the right software, and confused morals can operate. Anonymous are deluded fools if they think botnet attacks, using peoples computers and servers covertly, to coordinate DDoS attacks are a form of protest. Just shows their naivety. Anonymous are symptomatic of "me! me! me!" society, that the web has given a platform to hackers like the,. 

> The way this (DDoS) is done is through botnets. A botnet controller sends instructions to thousands or millions of zombie computers. These are computers that you use, your mom uses, your boss uses, your cousin uses, your kids use, or even your emergency responders use to save lives. [DDoS - Terrorism or legitimate form of protest?](http://www.zdnet.com/ddos-terrorism-or-legitimate-form-of-protest-7000011845/)

Hacktivism has been around for a while. Hacktivism is hacking, with political aims, but a much overused term these days. I find the tedious loose collective Anonymous particularly irritating, with the self-appointed grandeur and self-importance. Defacing websites, and DDoS attacks on carefully selected targets, that afford them the most publicity. A product of the increasingly individualistic society we live, where people performs acts for personal fame, rather than any coherent objective. Leaking has become a popular pastime, with little thought to consequences of the action. "Hacktivist", the term, is credited [Cult of the dead cow](http://w3.cultdeadcow.com), started in 1984, and the first accepted Hacktivists. These days they retain their elusiveness, at same time as providing security-related services. I always figure the real hackivists, the ones with true conscience, do not publicise what they are doing. They must watch the activities of Anonymous and their ilk, with disdain. 

#### 1989 WANK virus *singgers*

It would seem there is always a childish/mischievous edge to hacker activity, the glee of accessing what is set up to be inaccessible.  As demonstrated by what is generally considered the first act of hactivism on record ... 

> One of the earliest documented acts of hacktivism happened in 1989, when all the login screens in the network which NASA and several other government agencies used to sync their machines were altered to a digital image reading: "WORMS AGAINST NUCLEAR KILLERS... Your System Has Been Officially WANKed *singgers again*. You talk of times of peace for all, and then you prepare for war.

This has a sense of pure mischievousness, still prevalent in hacktivism today. But now masked by weak political activism posturing. Because so few actually know what they really do, it is far easier to romanticise it. Anonymous are self-defeatist in actions and purpose, as they themselves operate in covert manner, disinterested in havoc they cause for people, and mild irritation for authorities. They have already been easily infiltrated, as it doesn't take much to put the frighteners on "script kiddies". So their own integrity has been long compromised. They had their time, used peoples ignorance to their advantage to create a posing smokescreen of self-importance, vastly over-estimating their worth. They are part of the problem. There are a few who stand out better than most. the Jester is a favourite of mine, who generally specialises in attacking Islamic extremism websites. He also "plays", but with more morality, as he encrypts any data he retrieves, by covert means (to highlight security flaws on sensitive computer systems and networks). 

> I encrypt my [data] dumps as a matter of course because I am not the same as my detractors who drop personal info all the time

Something to keep in mind - Anonymous happy to use your computer/server without asking, and prepared to dump your personal data on the internet. Freedom fighters? Revolutionairies? Hardly.
