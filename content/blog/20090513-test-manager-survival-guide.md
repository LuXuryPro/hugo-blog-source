# Test Manager Survival Guide

After 12 years in testing, and 27 companies, I feel that now I should be writing a testing book.   And using the great tool [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to organise my thoughts.  As my specialism became by default, more chaotic projects, my approach to the book has been as survival guide for test managers in variety of scenarios. Aimed at testers also, and anyone who is interested to learn how testing discipline can be used to help all parts of the project.

Over the years one of the most important lessons I learned was however impossible the timescales and resources, there is always value to test process. As in life, people will latch on to a metaphorical "lifeboat" in chaotic environments, and QA is most natural central point.  As test resources, we are instantly place in the middle of actions and events, becoming a quality gate for requirements, releases, bugfixes, improvements. If we choose to place process, then this can help the rest of project people in their work.
