# Shithead card game

![shithead](http://home.pacific.net.au/~cavenagh/SH/screenshot.jpg)

> Shit head is a popular card game for two to six players in which players aim to avoid being the **last** player to get rid of his/her cards. The winner of the game is usually considered unimportant, although in some cases the winner is considered to be "redeemed," i.e. previous losses become annulled.

[Play Shithead](http://home.pacific.net.au/~cavenagh/SH/) I hunted around a lot over the years, trying to find a decent implementation of my favourite card game.Â  This one is great and allows custom settings.
