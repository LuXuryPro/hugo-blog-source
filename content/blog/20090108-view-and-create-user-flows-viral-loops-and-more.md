# View and Create Worfklows

![](http://productplanner.com/static/images/home/how_step1.png) [Product Planner - View and Create User Flows, Viral Loops, and More.](http://productplanner.com/) A throughly useful site with numerous example workflows.  Useful as there is only so many ways to write a workflow, and better to use tried-and-tested workflows as springboard.  The library is quite extensive and editing tools easy (you actually select workflow steps from list that displays, based on general workflow area you choose).  Good for an overview and demonstration, but not a tool to use to produce professional workflows (i.e. workflows for system design).
