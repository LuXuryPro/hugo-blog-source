# True Agile is happy productive team

Something that's plain post-Agile is it wasn't granular enough for public consumption.  Using the principles and devising your own way of working was far more practical. Of course people were already doing this prior to Agile becoming formalised manifesto.  Test driven development (TDD), Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Kanban all existed prior to the manifesto in 2001.  In fact Agile seems to be an aggregation of the the collective evolution of advances in quality process within engineering, production, and team management.  As with any latest fad, Agile became a start point, instead of a renaissance; it was a merge of all those advances, in media-friendly soundbites. All of a sudden everything pre-Agile became wrong, by default.  Previously disinterested business management, suddenly found a new tool to advance their careers, which they could promote without really understanding.  Agile was introduced as a term first, a cry to be "more Agile".  They may not have understood the term, but they did know it sounded positive and new. 

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

The classic example of the principle of having all important information "above the fold" is demonstrated in the [Twelve Principles of Agile Software](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). It is very plain the principles that were adopted stopped around "Build projects around motivated individuals ....". Yes, but what kind of motivation - advancement in career, more money, more power? Corporations need to tread very carefully around these principles, and need to be especially clear on definitions. The disclaimer underneath is essential approach. It does not suggest one is right, and the other is wrong. It got to ridiculous stage when you suggested tools or processes, people would wrinkle their noses in Agile-disgust. And then carried on with their efficient bug-tracking system using email. Programming is all about processes - without them it is structureless and chaotic. Maybe there is a future programming language that will work like that, but it isn't here yet. Running a project in an ad-hoc fashion, having too many meetings and unrealistic schedules creates more stress than on projects running using older methodologies. The part people generally avoid is Agile and psychology. Have a happy productive cross-functional team, and you have an Agile team. And it doesn't happen by magic.

Building trust and shared values on a team is critical. [Professional Team Management Tips For Creative Folks](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/03/professional-team-management-tips-for-creative-folks/)[/caption] Business management still relies on subterfuge as part of their career defence, and in fact the whole of business still plays an old fashioned game. So whatever changes are made to be more Agile on projects, it can be scuppered at management level by too much self-interest, and disengagement form the team. This can lead to a more lacklustre application of Agile at development level, as the project management becomes unrealistic. Quality of code will go downhill and people will not be so forthcoming is they are having problems with workloads. Management of the project team and their workload is paramount in Agile, so use more effective processes to deal with the specific roles. It is also worth promoting what you do to others, who can maybe learn from the successes/failures of Everything is up for review/change principle in Agile, including processes - and people!
