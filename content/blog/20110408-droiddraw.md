# DroidDraw

The excellent [DroidDraw](http://www.droiddraw.org/) is now available as standalone application (Linux included!). Java programmers may sniff, but the history and evolution of web development is ongoing creation of accessible tools for people to build on the web. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than a basic android application designer. If you want to do something more complex, then try more heavyweight method.
