# ScreenToaster - Free Online Screen Recorder

![](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/screentoaster.jpg)Another online tool that I have found useful for testing purposes.  This is a free screen recorder, which enables you to quickly generate anything from a tutorial to a demo of a software bug. 

### What is ScreenToaster ?

ScreenToaster is an online screencast service allowing to capture screen activity. To watch videos : Just click on a video to launch the player.  To record videos : Click on "Start recording" or "New recording", start recording using the shortcuts. When finished, add audio and subtitles, describe and tag your video so other users can easily find your screencasts.
