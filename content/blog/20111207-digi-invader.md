# DigiInvaders

Calculators really took off in the early eighties. The first effort ot "jazz" them up started with the game "Digi Invaders". I remember wasting a lot of time on this - in fact, it had no real end or even an increase in speed (it just felt like it as the numbers were pouring towards you). Remember loving it though. Click through to play game.  Instructions: Press the blue base key to start the game. Use the left arrow to change your number to match the number of the invader coming towards you. Then press the right arrow to destroy it. if (WIDGETBOX) WIDGETBOX.renderWidget('1164d8a4-31eb-40f3-a180-c35c0731c01c');Get the [DiGi iNVaDeRS - Casio MG-880 Game](http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/digi-invaders-casio-mg-880-game) widget and many other [great free widgets](http://www.widgetbox.com/) at [Widgetbox](http://www.widgetbox.com)!
