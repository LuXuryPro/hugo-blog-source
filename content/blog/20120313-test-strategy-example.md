# Test Strategy Example

![Test Strategy example](/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pdf1.png)Test strategies are often omitted because no-one ever reads them. And why aren't they read? well, sidestepping "laziness", it's that too often they are unhelpful. So instead of sighing and drumming up something useless, why not generate something useful instead. [Click here to view example of a risk based test strategy](http://jaffamonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/test-strategy1.pdf).  Judge the document content and aims project by project. If another test strategy is appropriate template for yours, use it - there are only so many times you can rewrite the same damn document. Personally, I don't bother with specific Test Plans, but extend information in the test strategy and test scripts. There is no real right and wrong, but you should keep within general QA framework ideals.
