Unsure as yet why this is - it is not for speed, as it is not noticably quicker than creating mindmaps directly (using something like Freemind).  But tried an xml file file, which came out in a good way, illustrating the goupings/hierarchy.  One of those things I keep bookmarked, and think about what to use it for another time.  So many web 2.0 inspired sites popping up there are bound o be many that are short-lived.
