# Halifax Online Banking - UK Banks, Finance, Personal, Telephone & Internet Banking

![](http://www.halifax.co.uk/common/images/hxlogo.gif) Halifax are not the only bank with this issue - they are all as bad as each other.  Having already screwed up their own finances, to be bailed out by tax payers, they seem intent on ignoring fraud, as it is to their own cost. Having been the unlucky victim of fraud, with someone using my debit card to have a very nice new year holiday in Tenerife, I started to look into this area.  It seems as if the attitude of banks/government/police is that victims can go to hell.  Even though I called immediately I saw a dodgy transaction, and my debit card was stopped, transactions pending are still allowed through - no doubt to avoid too much adminsitration or effort on the banks part, and an acceptance that fraud has occurred. Also found the [article](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23390837-details/Fraud%20victims%20told:%20Go%20to%20the%20bank,%20NOT%20the%20police/article.do) which highlights how much authorities have given up combating fraud in any real sense.  Leaving the banks to administer this is fatal for customers, as they become judge and jury.  Card fraud is symtomatic of the lazy approach banks take in encouraging us to spend money, and spend it fast.  They make it difficult from the individual to truly control our own money, and at the same time allow easy transaction processes, which are fraught with weaknesses.
