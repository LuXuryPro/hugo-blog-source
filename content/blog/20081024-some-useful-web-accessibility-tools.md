# Some useful web accessibility tools

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2008/11/colorwheel.jpg)There are plenty of good free tools out there to help with web accessibility testing - most web accessibility rules are common sense, and will widen your audience.  There are plenty of communities out there, with people with a range of disabilities.  Take a read of some [forums](http://www.accessifyforum.com/) and you will see that the web accessibility lessons are still being learnt.  As new assistive technologies develop then there are improvements, but web accessibility should always be factored into website design - at the very least it enforces good coding practices! [Firefox Accessibility Extension v1.4.5](http://firefox.cita.uiuc.edu/) A w3c approved accessibility plugin that covers most web accessibility problem areas. [Accessibility Color Wheel](http://gmazzocato.altervista.org/colorwheel/wheel.php) A tool to view effects of colors/contrast on color blindness of various types. [Lynx text-only browser](http://lynx.isc.org/) A great tool for highlighting the most common accessibility errors - illogical tab navigation, missing/unclear ALT tags, and form/field labels.
