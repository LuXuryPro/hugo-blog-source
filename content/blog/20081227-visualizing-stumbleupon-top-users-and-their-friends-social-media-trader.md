# Visualizing StumbleUpon Top Users And Their Friends | Social Media Trader

![](http://socialmediatrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/stumbleusers.gif)  


There has been some great analysis of [StumbleUpon top users ](http://www.viperchill.com/blog/analysis-stumbleupons-top-50-stumblers/)and of the [StumbleUpon algorithm](http://blog.venture-skills.co.uk/2007/09/19/stumbleupon-mathematics-for-stumblers/), but there has been little examination of the relationship between StumbleUpon users and their friends. After coming across interesting complex[ data visualization tools ](http://www.wikiviz.org/wiki/Tools)we wanted to visualize the stumblesphere of top users.
