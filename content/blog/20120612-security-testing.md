#### Security Testing is not a mystical art - well, it can be at a real hacker level, but you may be chasing your own tail trying to block all weaknesses.

But you can do a lot to prevent a lot of common website attacks, as there is a lot of software which automates certain types of security breaches. Overloading page forms is a very easy way, unless you have some basic protections against spamming programs. I can perform security review of your web application, and moreÂ importantly, provide information on how to fix issues, and leave guidance to avoid basic security issues re-appearing.
