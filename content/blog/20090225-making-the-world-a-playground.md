# Making the world a playground

> plaYce is a startup that is redefining quick-engagement games by providing high-end, media rich action, streamed within the browser. Think of plaYce as casual gaming for REAL gamers, enabling them to play quick-engagement social games with their online friends. Games are based in plaYce's 3D virtual world, which is accurately based on real world locations. Game developers can use plaYce's API to create their own games within this unique 3D world. plaYce's first game, Downtown Defender, is a 3D Tower Defense game that takes place in SF. The game provides amazing graphics that have never before been seen in the quick-engagement Web browser format. We will launch more games shortly in NYC and Hong Kong.
