# We love the system when it loves us

The mock surprise and indignation from people, who had long shut their ears to what I call the bleedin' obvious. That there are others poking around in our data, analysing with tools to pump out results, for variety of objectives. Whether analysis for marketing demographics, sales targeting, or terrorist spotting - we provide enough data publicly, let alone privately, to benefit those with business or national security. One person's warbling’s on Facebook, may not mean that much, but times it by millions of people, with even more millions of individual pieces of data and with the right algorithms, it can yield useful results. The indignation around what was happening, was not that the NSA is collected data covertly (which I believe is the core business of these agencies - covert surveillance). It was our beloved web service "mothers", highly likely to be shamefully complicit. Given they are all hiding behind banner off " we did not provide them with direct access ...", it is pretty plain they were in some way complicit. What annoys me even more is people's rather naive and frankly hypocritical response. A "how dare they" - the same people happy to point and laugh at someone photos, taken of random stranger in odd hat, mid nose-pick or simply "funny looking". The Nathan Barleys assume a privacy that for some reason in their muddy minds, doesn't apply to the bad people. Or indeed people we can laugh at. Scandals are uncovered all the time, but the indignation rises quickest in the greedy public, when it's something that directly affects them. Especially as the revelations are so unsurprising, almost a certainty, the reaction is one of shock. This delusion about our conscious awareness of high probability someone is using our data, is not quite as bad the delusion the affecting the 99 percenters. Anyone who took advantage of the mortgage and loan boom, were complicit in the banks behaviour. Would you really take a mortgage you know you could ill-afford in the long-term? That's short-term, self-oriented thinking. Anyone with a grip of basic maths would have an inkling something wouldn't entirely add up. That it had the fragility of a pyramid scheme. Of course the answer our charming government applied was to bring the system up again - but now more ruthless. Clever move. So back to the Big Data scandal. I doubt much will change, as there is little legal precedent here and I am sure even if it was forced to court, it would be damn easy to justify it in justification of national security. The whittering about funky "Big Data" dried up quickly after scandal broke, as "Big Data" had been hyped up to the max, by marketers and band-wagon jumpers. There are a lot of positive ways, and completely valid social and business reasons, to manipulate data for our advantage. To a degree, I think to expect too much privacy is unrealistic. But that does entail those who hold our data to be a lot more transparent.
