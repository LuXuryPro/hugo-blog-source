# I can see you, but I ain't listening

The web is annoying - arrogant web services are telling what I want to see, buy, and even who influences me. A befuddled dictatoral mess of a semantic web, which relies on premise of "I can see you, but I ain't listening".  Overselling new advances is a tedium we have had to put up with for many years, but now this overselling is much more invasive to point when I am regularly saying "Oh, fuck off!" at the screen.  The web has entered an era of wholesale bullshit, which I am presuming is also it's death knell. 

> HTTP is called a _[stateless_](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/stateless.html) protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement [Web sites](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/web_site.html) that react intelligently to user input.

We are still tied to a web infrastructure, desgined primarily for text, and "souped up" by various other technologies (ActiveX, Java, JavaScript and cookies etc.) It's archaic, it's tedious, sold as magic when it is in fact a smart evolution of networking, hardly worthy of the romantic futuristic ideal.  Apparently anyone who has a  new web service venture by anyone under 30, is the new "Mark Zukerberg".  That alone is a damming statement, as facebook is still firmly rooted in old-style web 2.0 control freakery.  Nothing is forever and http is no different. At the moment it is being used (ironically) as covert information gathering, i.e. mostly text.  I have no doubt there are advances and alternatives already, but the "big boys" have a lot more uses, to screw out of the old system yet.
