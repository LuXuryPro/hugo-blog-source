# HowSociable?

![howsociable_wordpress1](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/howsociable_wordpress1-150x47.png)What [Keith Barrett](http://www.keithbarret.com) would call "just a bit of fun".   It searches a lot of major social networking/bookmarking sites for occurences of search term (i.e. your name or ID).  I was interested to finds my ID appears on sites I signed up to, but never used, such as ecademy and ning.  But sometimes interesting to find out where you have been mentioned!  Needs to cover a load more sites though.
