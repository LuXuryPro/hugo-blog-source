# Arrogance has no place in IT world - an ...

Arrogance has no place in IT world - an area that definitely fits the old adage (maybe a little un-PC now) 

> Dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants (Latin: nanos gigantium humeris insidentes) is a Western metaphor meaning "One who develops future intellectual pursuits by understanding the research and works created by notable thinkers of the past"; a contemporary interpretation. From good ol' (and much maligned) wikipedia (you don't like it, then you fucking do it then!)

Google, another much maligned organization have adopted the phrase for [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/). I like Google as a company and their ethos - to get that large and maintain some kind of ethics must be difficult to balance. Android is already kicking Apple-ibutt, but google aren't rushing still - they know people (like me) are chomping at the bit to get pc desktop version of it, and also Google have confidence not to rush out a pile of shit to take advantage of that. I am a little wary of going through pain of source code install though! So will wait patiently for a nice installer. The difference between Google, Microsoft and Apple is that 2 of them want to screw you on a regular basis, only concerned for their own self-gratification (wankers). The other one is like a pleasant control freak :) I know which one I prefer.
