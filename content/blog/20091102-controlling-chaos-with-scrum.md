# Controlling Chaos With SCRUM

SCRUM is not only a solution, it is also effective in highlighting areas of concern, that arise from Rapid Development practices.  From the [Control Chaos](http://www.controlchaos.com) SCRUM site, they have a good list of the possibilities - and certainly ones that I have seen over the years. 

>   1. Identifying the backlog for a planning session may point out that management doesn't have clear marketplace vision and can't clearly identify what they want to do.
>   2. Identifying backlog for a product may identify that the competition is now well understood.
>   3. Identifying backlog for design may point out that adequate design techniques are not being used.
>   4. Conducting Sprints with an identified backlog may point out that worker are constantly being interrupted by interests outside the Sprint and cannot complete top priority assignments.
>   5. Daily Scrums may point out the absence of version control mechanisms as daily builds don't occur because of overlaid or unknown code.
>   6. Daily Scrums may point out that people have far less time to devote to the work than management had thought.
>   7. Daily Scrums may point out that workers are far less competent than previously assumed, or are in power struggles that stop progress.
>   8. Daily Scrums may point out that staff spends hours per day getting coffee across the street because none is supplied internally.

SCRUM effectively shows convoluted processes, and it is important to react to them. The beauty of SCRUM is its ability to identify uncontrolled chaos in time and skills - and reengineering are principles factored into both Agile and SCRUM.  One of the common errors I see from QA standpoint, is cheery picking approach to princi0ples, and living in the Sprint, rather than taking broader view (for fear of failing).  Failure is a big part of technology, I think we can all agree.  The important thing is to learn and adapt with the failures.
