# 37+ and still learning ...

After working for 37 companies, I consistently blamed business as main point of weakness on IT projects. But after reading [this article](http://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/society-and-the-analytic-mindset-2/), I felt I had slipped into the same generalisations that just plain aren't helpful. I do believe it is far easier to point out problems rather than solutions (stand up, way too many testers). Process always sounds so logical, doesn't it? My origins are from working on step-down projects, where each project stage was completed before moving on (with little chance of going back). Â  That is perfectly suited to the way we are educated to break down problems into smaller parts. To do things in order, with structure. Resolve the parts and you resolve the whole. Well, that's the idea. Agile and Lean introduced new concepts around creating fluidity in project stages. Requirements and development could run in parallel (as could testing). It sounds great - but it requires us to battle the education implant - to break down and analyse in sequential chunks. The current obsession with finding ultimate tools to manage Agile projects shows how far off the point people have gone. Agile has become a money-making exercise, with little relevance to what its (admittedly vague) manifesto was. It wasn't intended to go global, and struggled with continual addendum to fill the gaps around project management. Agile was after all primarily a development methodology. Common sense tells you that when you have a collection of tasks and bugs to organise, you don't just timetable at random - some work will be better done in parallel, and some may need to be combined. There is a lot of project management involved in maintaining Agile effectively, and I mean ongoing and daily! It's no good if development is Agile, but project management is ineffective (regardless of methodology).
