# The Art of User Stories

![who-what-why](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/who-what-why-150x108.png)User story approach is sound, but as with all things simple, it can end up complicated.  The main reason for this is not observing the fundamentals of a user story.  Also, it is worth keeping in mind a user story **AND **the scenrios breakdowns should be clear and understandable to **ANYONE**, whether they are a user, stakeholder, developer or tester. To address what a user story is, lets start by saying what it isnt: 

> It isnt a “mini” Use Case It isnt a complete specification It isnt a contract (User Stories can be amended at any point - Agile welcomes change) It isnt intended to be interpreted without a Product Owner (this is simply not Agile)

**A user story template can be illustrated as follows:**

_As a <User or role> I want <Business Functionality> so that <Business Justification>”_

**Example: ** _As an Editor, I want to be able to enable my authors to publish articles immediately to live, in order to avoid delays where delays are unaceptable._ This user story can be broken down into senarios, i.e. the different conditions where an author would need publish to live, without going through an Editor. Scenario 1: When an article needs editing because of libellious content Scenario 2: When no Editor is available to vet articles. Scenario 3: Articles delivered from trusted authors external to company. ...... etc. These scenarios become the breakdown of the main user story, and indication of work required. Depending on scope of the scenarios, will determine if the User Story can be deifned as an "Epic". An "Epic" are  compound Stories, that can be broken down into several smaller, more focused stories, and may encompass enough work for several Sprints (iterations). Some guidelines to writing good User Stories 

  * Tangible acceptance tests can be written against User Story
  * The scope of the User Story is manage-able enough for the team to provide an Estimate
  * Is independent and do not rely on other Stories
  * Sized appropriately (i.e. have a level of effort which the team can comfortably achieve in the duration of a single iteration).
