# Capitalism 3.0

![capitalism 3.0](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/c30.png)

We are addressing the technology evolution, but what about the business behind the ventures that implement technology into a service. Technology moves at phenomenal pace, yet business seems to lag a decade behind, often misunderstanding and misinterpreting the philosphies. The reason - simple, the philosophies dont always make business sense, in fact rarely. Maybe as short-term business success, but that goes against most traditional business models. Business has yet to evolve, but this little gem sparked my imagination and inspiration for truly new approach. The current glut of conglomarations, swallowing up businesses, with management mess from boardroom downwards are the last death throes of capitalism. As the principle of capitalism is grow or die, it is true to form. But capitalism is reaching its boundaries, and the fall will be spectacular. The concept of business being smaller, and growing through networking, rather than market dominance and central control, is an appealing one. web 2.0 was a draft for a new kind of business as well as a draft towards semantic web. But web 2.0 is already being used as a corporate tool, albeit clumsy and selectively implemented. Just as many IT projects nodded towards "Agile", the same companies are nodding yet again to another buzz, web 2.0 .... Important to remember, the boom/busts in technology were not caused by technology failing to deliver, but failure of business to deliver.

> Our current version of capitalismâ€”the corporate, globalized version 2.0â€”is rapidly squandering our shared inheritances. Now, Peter Barnes offers a solution: protect the commons by giving it property rights and strong institutional managers. Barnes shows how capitalismâ€”like a computerâ€”is run by an operating system. Our current operating system gives too much power to profit-maximizing corporations that devour our commons and distribute most of their profit to a sliver of the population. And governmentâ€”which in theory should defend our commonsâ€”is all too often a tool of those very corporations. Barnes proposes a revised operating systemâ€”Capitalism 3.0â€”that protects the commons while preserving the many strengths of capitalism as we know it. His major innovation is the commons trustâ€”a market-based entity with the power to limit use of scarce commons, charge rent, and pay dividends to everyone. Capitalism 3.0 offers a practical alternative to our current flawed economic system. It points the way to a future in which we can retain capitalismâ€™s virtues while mitigating its vices.
