# User Stories Approach to Web Development

![user_story](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/user_story-150x150.jpg)A User Story can be written by any User. The User Story should have a short but descriptive title and a longer description. The decription should include the 5 Ws: Who, What, When, Where and Why. This will also make requirements clearer to development teams, as the focus is not only on the functional, but on the audience. User stories also free the developers to be creative in providing a solution, because they are focused only on the business need and not on the analyst’s perception of today’s (or yesterday’s) technical constraints. WHO: Usually, the type of user WHAT: What the user in the WHO is going to do WHEN: "When" may describe a time or date or relative time (e.g After logging in or after performing a search) WHERE: Where on the page or in the application. WHY: What was the trigger for the user (user wants to suggest a change to the blog post) Example 1: A user (who) clicks the article comment button (what) after reading a article (when) located at the bottom of the article (where) in order to make a comment about the article (why). Example 2: An administrator (who) has determined which users to put into which discussion groups (why, when). Viewing the user listing for a group (where) clicks the checkboxs next to several users, selects a discussion group from the drop down and clicks the add to discussion group (what). Example 2 is a bit more complicated. The "what" is a bit more protracted and the "why" and "when" are combined. For more complex stories it may be easier to list the 5 Ws first: Who: An Administrator What: Selects multiple Users(at once) and adds them to a discussion group When: After determining what Users go in which groups. Where: From the User listing screen. Why: To get Users into discussion groups. Using the 5Ws method can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes for users to produce good stories. When all stories are written this way they become easier to estimate and the why element give valuable insight into what a user expects from the application. This is a modern way to gather requirements, user-driven rather than technically driven. **Example Scenario:** Example of why User Stories are a better approach overall The Functional Spec includes a non-functional requirement for an overnight batch run to create a particular database report. Upon evaluating the user requirements it is discovered that this report was for only one person, who liked to begin each day by looking over yesterday’s figures. So we turned the requirement around and wrote it from that user’s point of view. Now the non-functional requirements is replaced by a user story concerning this persons’s wish to read that report. It completely replaces the earlier non-functional statement, which was clearly a solution, not a requirement.
