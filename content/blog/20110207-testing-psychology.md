# If I wanted to be cynical ...

If I wanted to be cynical I would say that when the user truly had power to have opinions, a lot of testers suddenly dropped out. Within a project where the user is dictated to, i.e. "don't question us", testing can proceed in an orderly manner. Business and development requirements only change if deemed necessary, but are not based on any kind of user contribution. Not surprising since human nature, in general, looks for shortcuts.  The end user or client are often viewed as necessary evil, rather than valuable team member. Which is one of agile guiding principles - along with happy team mentality that does well for creativity and (I hate this word) blues thinking. On denote I only ever hear that phrase on projects that are failing.it is a shame as that approach should be applied at the outset. Re-inventing the wheel is not pointless, as there are always ways to improve it. What is making testing interesting is the rise of psychology in test approaches, particularly in usability. Web and software have become hugely rich in features and design. And what looks good to marketing may be an atrocious user experience. Developers don't really have the focus on usability because of the mindset required. Project managers want to fulfil client expectations or simply get the perceived job done on time. The product owner wants to ensure the clients get what they want (or think they want). All valid views but no view should be driving the project. That's where Qa can really help, providing a test approach that takes all views into account, and testing to requirements in more exploratory detail. Our position is unique as we are "welcome outsiders" - like the end user in fact! Successful testing is not just finding faults. It is about contribution and reporting issues advisory capacity. Qa is a much a part of the requirements machine as anyone - just adopt more flexible stance and remember that a tester who only gives good news is not doing it right. Be vocal - there are a lot more requirements errors than functional ones ad general rule. And that requires a different tester mindset.
