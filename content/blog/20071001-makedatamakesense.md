# makedatamakesense

With [microformats](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/in/?p=402) and [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748), you can now start getting a feel of how the semantic web would feel. makedatamakesense.com go one step further and offer proxy services to extract data from microformat-friendly sites. ![makedatamakesense](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/makedatamakesense.png)
