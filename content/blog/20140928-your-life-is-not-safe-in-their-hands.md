# Your life is not safe in their hands

### Place: MediCentre in Victoria station

It appears as if the almost world famous crap British service has reached medicare ... 

> Receptionist: Good morning (started well at this point) Me: Good morning - I have an earache and want to get it checked out as it has been a week now Receptionist: What have to used to clear the wax? Me: Eh? Receptionist: What have to used to clear the wax? Me: It's earache, I don't want an ear syringe Receptionist: But what have to used to clear the wax? Me: Sigh! I use olive oil usually. Receptionist: Olive Oil?? (with look of disgust) Me: Yes, it's recommended by hospitals and GP's, but it doesn't help. Receptionist: So you want an ear syringe? Me: As there is also puss occasionally coming out, I don't think that is good idea. Receptionist: (says nothing, but looks even more disgusted) **_At this point a more senior lady interrupted by telling receptionist that I need to see doctor as it sounds like an infection. She also had a look of exasperation of someone that has experience under their belt but been consigned to easier and less well-paid wo_**rk. **_Now in doctor's office ..._** Doctor: So what is the problem? Me: I have earache, like the kind I had as a kid. Painful and been going a week now. **_Doctor peers in my ear with his gizmo ..._** Doctor: I can't see much its so swollen Long pause and a smile Me: (breaking pause) So what can I do? Doctor: Its swollen around that side of the face a bit too. Me: (losing patience) Something to do with the infection, I guess? Doctor writes a prescription Doctor: You can buy this here Me: So it's not available in chemist? Doctor: Oh, yes Me: And is it cheaper? Doctor: Yes (with a smirk that now has me wanting to punch him)

### Cost: £70 (would have been another £12 if I had bought the anti-biotic ear drops from them)

### Summary: How the hell do these people even get allowed to provide such dire premium charge service. Avoid medicentres, even for a syringe - I wouldn't trust them with a thermometer, let alone anything else.
