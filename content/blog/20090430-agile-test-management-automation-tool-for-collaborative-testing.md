# Agile Collaborative Testing

ANother great testing tool from the makers of Selenium suite of products.  This one netaly ties in the testing process, from requirements through to execution and reporting.  Fitnesse did do this to some degree, but this is a much more user-friendly product, and at reasonable cost for a supported and stable product.
