# 20 Email Design Best Practices

![email](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/email-150x150.jpg)Email has always lagged behind in terms of standards.  There is still an existing prolem using css and divs with newsletter-style emails, which contradicts basic coding standards. 

> Web standards may have become the norm for coding pages for display in web browsers, but this isn't the Web, baby. Mail clients are light years behind the eight-ball in terms of CSS support, which means that we must resort to using tables for layout if we really want our newsletters to display consistently for every reader http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/code-html-email-newsletters

This makes the task of ensuring your emails are cross-browser friendly.  It is worth remebering that people use browsers to access emails frequently - not just Hotmail, yahoo, etc, and the many POP email based web clients (such as mail2web).  <TABLE> is used over <DIV>, which is the first common problem to surmount. This is a great guide of how to at least avoid common email formatting pitfalls.
