# Convert Cobol to Visual Basic or C++ WHY???

![cobol](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/09/cobol-150x59.gif)This is just a funny idea - I love COBOL as a language, but so bizarre to see a need to convert it to the heap-of-crap that is Visual Basic - the equivalent of using a wheelchair whilst on crutches.  No slur on lordcobol intended!  You might find a use for it yourself, I guess :) [LordCobol.net - Convert Cobol to Visual Basic or C++](http://www.lordcobol.net/)
