# 5 quick effective steps for "emergency testing"

![xhtml_dtd](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/xhtml_dtd-150x102.gif)5 quick effective steps for "emergency testing", i.e. when testing is left until last minute! 1\. Your site should be passing [XHTML Transitional](http://validator.w3.org) \- there are no excuses! Most of the standards are relaetd to code quality and there is no excuse for omitting important data such as form labels, Alt texts, etc. Conforming to these standards will help with any potential issue with browser compatibility and accessibilty. ![osbrowser](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/osbrowser-150x66.jpg)2\. Use [Browsercam](http://www.browsercam.com) service to get a quick view on what you site looks like in ALL OS/Browser combinations. Debian/Konqueror is included, just to give you idea on how extensive this test is! ![wcag2-sc](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/wcag2-sc-150x102.jpg)3\. Use Accessibility tools such as [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)](http://wave.webaim.org/toolbar) \- they are no replacement for testing with devices and software, but pragmatic given the costs that full accessibility testing can entail. If Accessibility is a real business imperative then companies such as Shoretrust have real disabled users who use equipment/software, and can report on your site. ![broken-link](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/broken-link-150x112.jpg)4\. Broken links program will highlight any glaring omissions or dead links. There are many services that will do this - this is a [link checker](http://www.dead-links.com/) that I use. If you want to check reciprocal links, then seperate checker exists [here](http://www.recip-links.com/). ![homepage](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/homepage-150x150.gif)5\. Homepages can easily suffer from size issues, and running the homepage through a [webpage analyzer](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/), can not only report but suggest on how to optimize. Images are still most common area for improvement - images should ALWAYS be optimised for web.
