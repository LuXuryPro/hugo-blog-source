# Code bloat

Every web application developer should learn html, css and javascript coding standards - given how frequently they are also charged with resultant front-end output. The forgiving nature of modern browsers can mask a whole heap of problems, that will cause performance issue, and on more extreme level, applications errors. Sloppy html coding can result in passwords being exposed, session tokens visible in URL's - so security can be an issue also.  This presentation is a few years old, but things don't change that fast with coding standards. Application developers tend to dismiss front-end issues. Quite understandably, as functionality is important - but if the end website is a pain in the rear to use, what's the point. The easiest way to quickly guage how good your website coding is, is access the site through screenreader emulator (WebbIE is one, but there are others). These tools rely on good coding standards in order to recognise page elements, and to initiate functional elements, such as buttons and forms.
