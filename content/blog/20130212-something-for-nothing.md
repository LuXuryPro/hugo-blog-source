# Something for Nothing

Business services for consultants  contractors and small companies are popular, as most of us only need an address for Companies House or odd bits of mail.  Generally had no problem until these guys at [WestOne ](http://www.westone-business.com/). I realised after a year that they had not even forwarded one bit of mail.  I get mail very rarely so didn't think too much of it, until I got proof that indeed letters were sent and never forwarded.  My wife sent a test one, which again never arrived.  WestOne approach to my queries was to repeatedly send invoice reminders instead of answering my two simple questions:- 1\. What address do you have on file to forward mail to. 2\. What was the last mail I received. They can't provide the answer but are still trying the lazy bullying tactic of repeatedly submitting invoice reminders.  Manually, I might add. Has anyone else had experience of this at WestOne or any other similar business service?
