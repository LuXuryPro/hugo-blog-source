# Kanban 1s Game

### Jon Jagger's Kanban 1s Game

A game can always help understand logic puzzles, and that's the way to understand how Kanban works in a simulation. The advantage of using games to learn is that people will make more honest choices, as there are no company or project pressures to influence their choices. It's based on rational thought ... and a little by chance (you can't eradicate the unpredictable).
