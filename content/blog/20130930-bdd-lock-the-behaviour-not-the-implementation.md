# BDD vs TDD

> BDD - Lock the behaviour not the implementation

The example based on sorting sums up BDD testing perfectly (at 4:25).  The beauty of BDD is once you have your **given**'s, **when**'s and **then**'s, you can start mixing up scenario statements to test different possible outcomes.  Or exploratory testing, if it needs a name.
