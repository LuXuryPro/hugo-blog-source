# Testing is a confusing enough area as it is

Testing is a confusing enough area as it is - there is an obession amongst test professionals to constantly dissect methodologies. For example - [Usability vs User Acceptance Testing](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/expert/KnowledgebaseAnswer/0,289625,sid92_gci1289512,00.html). Lets not forget the purpose of testing, web testing especially - which is .... does it work, and does it not p*ss me off. Usability is the BEST approach to any website development, and through this testing can uncover a host of non-usability errors - its all in the approach and test script design.
