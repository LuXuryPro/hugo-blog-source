# Tube Adventure: A Bilingual Quest Game on YouTube

> The popular Spanish YouTube channel Pinofas has created a novel project: it's an hero adventure quest live-action game that takes advantage of the new video annotation capabilities that YouTube has implemented, called [Tube Adventure](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/31/tube-adventure-a-bilingual-quest-game-on-youtube/). In The [Tube Adventure](http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/07/31/tube-adventure-a-bilingual-quest-game-on-youtube/), our hero leaves his house to buy some bread, but a vase falls on his head and gives him amnesia: he needs your help getting to the bakery, and on the road he'll meet other characters which will assign missions, should you choose to accept them. The goal is finding the bakery and purchasing bread, and multiple endings have been designed into the game.
