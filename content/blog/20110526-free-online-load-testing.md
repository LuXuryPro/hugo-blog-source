# Free online load testing

![Load Impact](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/05/logo.gif)A useful quick load test tool (for free you can get steady rampup of 50 users, which is enough to do some initial analysis).

It won't work through proxies, but then that's your fault :) If you want to use the proliferation of online tools, it is better to restrict access to your alpha/beta site by IP access. Too many companies shoot themselves in the foot with paranoid proxies which can make developer and tester life hell!

With this tool you can load test a site URL 4 times a day, and registration enable you to save test configurations and results to your account. Worth the short registration.
