# Screen Resolutions

![screenres](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/screenres-150x119.png)Screen resolution usage puts 1024x768 are the most popular, and a lot of this can be put down to the standard 15inch screen laptop (1024/768 looks best on this), and even on larger screens it is still a preference. The 960 is a very popular grid-desgin format to follow. What should be considered is how your site appears on a mobile. There is no sense in maintaining two websites, one for mobile or for PC access - better to make your site mobile- friendly. Mobile browsers have become more intelligent, and can render sites either by resizing to screens resolution, or displaying data differently using browser detection when a page loads. The latter is preferable, as the former really depends on the size of the mobile screen. But if you do want the resize option, then 800x600 is a better resolution to aim for. For Flash, due to continued evolvement of mobile browsers, these are less of a mobile compatibility issues (they will always be resized according to screen resolution). On that note, it is not wise to omit considering the version of Flash you are designing in, as older browsers and mobile browsers may not support. In technology, the latest is never the best!
