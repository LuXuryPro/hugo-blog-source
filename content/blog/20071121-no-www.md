# no-www

One of my grumpyoldman whinges on the web, is that usally i just type domain name without the "www". If a websites dns is setup fully then this doesnt matter. But I am finding more and more websites, including large corporate sites that omit including the domain name itself. Going round goverment sites is good way to find most examples. Try this in the browser - http://companieshouse.gov.uk - and you get a "Page Not Displayed" error.

no-www.org are a coherent voice on this basic subject, and provide a good validator for your own website. Worthwhile exercise, to highlight any blatant oversights. Below is example of the output ...
