# Test And Dev Cycle Clashes

> "The number one cause of Software bugs is the **Specification"**Â <http://www.onestoptesting.com/introduction/test-start.asp>

As testing becomes more and more integrated with development process, it is becoming difficult to know where to draw the line.Â The line I draw is from point where a programmers has coded, and performed unit testing.Â Even then, it may not warrant tester involvement, as the ideal to strive for is to test as complete a system as is scoped (i.e. as close to live system as possible).Â Test Management is driven by requirements, with combination of development AND more importantly business requirements.Â The flipside of testers getting involved in low-level testing is that the bigger test picture gets clouded.Â The positive of course is it builds up a good relationship between development teams and the test team.Â The solution I found on several projects was to assign tester(s) solely to development team for pair-programming, and ensured they liaised with the rest of the test team.Â However this is a luxury for most company project budgets. We (the test team) are not interested in the puzzle pieces in themselves; we are more interested with how they fit together.Â Is that a fair statement?
