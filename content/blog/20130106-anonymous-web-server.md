# Anonymous web server

If you had a mind to use an anonymous web server, then [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/) is worth a look. And offer a lot more besides, covering - anonymous web browsing, web hosting, chat, file sharing, e-mail, blogging and content syndication, newsgroups, as well as several other applications under development. 

  * Web browsing: using any existing browser that supports using a proxy.
  * Chat: IRC, Jabber, I2P-Messenger.
  * File sharing: I2PSnark, Robert, iMule, I2Phex, PyBit, I2P-bt and others.
  * E-mail: susimail and I2P-Bote.
  * Blog: using e.g. the pebble plugin or the distributed blogging software Syndie.
  * Distributed Data Store: Save your data redundantly in the Tahoe-LAFS cloud over I2P.
  * Newsgroups: using any newsgroup reader that supports using a proxy.
