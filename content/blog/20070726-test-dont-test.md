# Test, Don't Test

![johnny test](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/images/johnnytest.jpg) It's easy to take testers for granted - the expectations is for testers to contribute to qulaity, while at the same time this expectation suddenly disappears when test results mean bad news for the release schedule. It is always a puzzling position for QA Manager, as part of the role is total adaptibility (within reason) to the project environment and demands. It is easy enough to reel off standards for Agile, SCRUM, RAD - but when it comes to enforcing them, it is amzing how quickly quality standards are suddenly seen as part of the problem by development, rather than highlighting problems. Having pushed through project releases myself, when I didnt entirely agree with it, I know that working in QA can be sometimes precarious. I would like to think my reasoning for pushing releases through was sound - sometimes a short-term decision is needed to ensure the overall success of the project.
