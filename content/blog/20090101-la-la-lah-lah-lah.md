# la la lah lah lah

I have had a jingle going round my head the last few weeks, the result of being in front of the televisions a few times after 2am. "Lah lah lah, la la lah lah lah, la la lah lah lah, please text me .. Lah lah lah, la la lah lah lah, la la lah lah lah, i think i want to text". It is hard to convey the fabulous tune that accompanies these lyrics in writing, but those who have seen the ad, will know it straightaway. I watch it, baffled on several levels - 

  * One text costs £1.50, which would be a costly and frustrating way to converse ("stop waffling girl, you are chewing up my monthly Flext allowance!")
  * The admittedly pretty girls somehow suggesting your text will be going to one of them (surely a little misleading)
  * The inanity of the advert - I guess it doesnt matter, it is imparting basic info - pretty girls, promise of sex, and the number to text drilled into your brain at every opportunity.
I think ads at this level have no subtly, so if you are hooked then you only hve yourself to blame when you cry into your mobile phone bill.    Onetext-dating  website even felt compelled to state "Real women reply to messages -not a computer".  Well, thats a relief then.  What really interests my marketing head, is that even though I have no intention of using such a dodgy looking service, the ad has infected my brain better than any fucking bafta Guiness ad.  Go, go, cheesy cheap advertising!
