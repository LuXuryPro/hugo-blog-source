# Visualization tool: ManyEyes on Vimeo

> At the Future of Civic Media conference at the MIT Media Lab in June, one of the best presentations came from the co-creator of ManyEyes. Here's a 7-minute video interview I did with Fernanda B. Viegas, research staff member of IBM's Visual Communication Lab in Cambridge, following her talk. Fernanda describes some of uses of this visualization tool. For example, during the Congressional testimony of then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a visualization Word Map graphically showed how often he used the phrases "I don't know" and "I don't recall."
