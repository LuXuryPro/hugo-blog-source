# Nokia slow cooker

I got tired quickly of the slow ear-roasting properties of the N95 (and to be balanced, I think most smartphones are the same), and went back to an old favourite, the w580i (part of the sweet 500 series).   A friend of mine used to be on his mobile so much he got large (benign) tumors on his neck behind his ears.  He was permanently cemented to his mobile, but still a cautionary reminder. ![580i_2](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/580i_2.jpg) Back to w580i - as well as fine walkman software, and a nice quality feel to it, it is just a very good mobile phone, for those of us that still spend a lot of time talking and txting.   The camera may only be 2Mp, but the quality is better than a lot of the 5Mp+ phones.  I have generally found the higher the Mp, the more necessary it is that your photographic subjects stay still!  Which with an 18month year old is a challenge too far - about 60 blurry pictures, dada started growling under his breath.  The best thing about this phone is it works fast, has great sound and  looks good.
