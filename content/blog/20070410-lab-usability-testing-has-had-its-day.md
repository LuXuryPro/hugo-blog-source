# Lab usability testing has had it's day

![lab usability is dead](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/71/166930445_606cd8fd01.jpg?v=0) Â <http://uselog.blogspot.com/2007/01/lab-usability-is-dead.html> The inherent issues with lab testing, are in its failure to emulate real-life scenarios.Â Â However, this is not always the point to a test, and there are still benefits to a controlled test environment - even for usability testing.Â A lot of usability testing is based on standards in design and coding - ideally done early on in a project, but virtually always imossible to do so.Â Â Projects generally move at an over-ambitious pace these days, and a lot that goes wrong AND right is to do with this approach.Â Why "Agile" has become a popular term to use to describe a project is the general Agile principles of short release cycles, and close project team relationships. Generally, in fast paced project, that is the only choice, otherwise theproject would fail a lot earlier.Â Â It is becoming more impossible to lay down set standards for project management appraoches, it is a much more reactive and people-based form of directing.Â But in QA, it is possible to help identify problems from a more distant viewpoint.
