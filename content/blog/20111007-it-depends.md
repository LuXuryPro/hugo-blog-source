# It depends ...

Too many Agile methodologies end with "it depends...". The dangers of loose methodology, you increase potential to get it wrong. [Kanban](http://blog.outsystems.com/aboutagility/2010/11/scrum-vs-kanban.html) is a great example of a very good idea - to take SCRUM then make it more flexible. The Backlog, Sprint and future Sprint tasks are completely fluid, unlike SCRUM in which Sprints are predefined, and do not change during a Sprint. kanban rules states you can change priorities at any time. If you want a simplistic view, it's designed to make the work-in-progress manageable. Overload is common problem in SCRUM, where one Sprint spills into another quickly resulting in unrealistic workloads. There's something wrong here though ... it appears that kanban is more an effort to plugin SCRUM weaknesses, rather than develop a rule-set of its own. It has too few rules, and I can only see it working when applied to SCRUM. That also points to the fact that SCRUM have been left "fallow" - it hasn't evolved much since it's inception. Following this train of thought, I began to think maybe all of these Agile and SCRUM related methodologies are attempting to solve problems that are not yet addressed in Agile or SCRUM. I may be over-simplifying a little, but I hope I am illustrating a point. What I appreciated about SCRUM was its clarity (compared to the rest of the bunch). But it is seen as rigid, simply because of the information boundary of the SCRUM guide. Unfortunately in IT, we can sometimes forget that we are also supposed to think for ourselves.

Agile is a framework, as is SCRUM. Methodologies such as BDD and kanban sprung from these frameworks. So instead of viewing this process as a negative, i.e. weakness in Agile or SCRUM. What you are actually doing in using the framework to produce something that suits you. Call me crazy - but doesn't that make total sense?
