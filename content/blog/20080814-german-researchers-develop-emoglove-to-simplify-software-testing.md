> Bodo Urban, the head of the 25 researchers involved in the project, says his basic goal is to improve the relation between man and machine with the so-called EmoGlove. The technology helps to track all movements of the mouse and all keystrokes on the keyboard of a PC. It’s also possible to track eye movements and a person’s facial expressions.

I like this a lot! The growing area of "emotional testing" directly sprung from first games, then websites. Thinking about it, this kind of equipment has been around awhile in medicinal or military applications. But a good application of technology hardware to contribute to testing. Its still a basic piece of equipment, when coming to sensitivity... 

> researchers say the EmoGlove technology still has difficulties registering weaker emotional reactions, for example boredom.

... I am sure the fast march of hardware advancement (or maybe software advancement?), will iron out these issues out.
