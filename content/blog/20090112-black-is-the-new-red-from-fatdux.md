# Black is the new Red (from FatDux)

![](http://www.fatdux.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/red-300x225.jpg) Oh this is just class - and good demonstration of the misuse of "metadata" to cover up data errors.  Scrawling a color name on there was cheaper than forking out for a real red button, but also given it a more convoluted "user experience" :) The author could at least have written it the right way up!  Dont get me started on "Dumb Britain", I will be posting all day ... 

> To exit the UCLA family pool via the disabled access ramp (the shortest path to the parking lot) one must pass through an electric gate.  There is a sign near the gate that says, “To open gate, push red button”.  The button was replaced recently, and the new button is black, but the sign was not changed.  The button has a new metadata tag though.
