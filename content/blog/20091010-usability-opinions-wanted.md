# Usability Opinions Wanted

![urbanstorage](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/urbanstorage-150x98.png)I am working on project around classified, and naturally decided on wordpress to do this solution.  I would appreciate any feedback regards usability of the site.  As well as being to register, it is possible to login using Twitter/Facebook/MySpace/AOL/Google ids.  Feel free to go nuts - this is a test site regularly backed up, so know no testing boundaries ;)
