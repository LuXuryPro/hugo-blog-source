# I think standards are attractive

![standards](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/standards.png) "I think standards are attractive".  After recovering from a major childish giggling fit, after hearing this, I said that may be calling standards "attractive" may be pushing it.   Business usually attributes the word "attractive" in terms of potentially profitable ideas.  Salaries can also be "attractive" for the same reason.  Standards are really more akin to a desperately unfashionable but practical haircut.  You can't make HTML5 code validation sexy, because it isn't for sale, as such.  You can sell the resulting quality, but really as most will not understand why it's important, it will be a reaction to sales fluff.  "Well,  it sounds good, even if I don't understand". For most developers, adhering to standards is distinctly unattractive.  As well as reigning in cavalier code, it also introduces challenges if certain features demand coding that could easily compromise those sexy standards (see, it just doesn't work).  Testers like standards, as in the long run, they save pointless regression issues, in addition to minimising dull bugs found, that really should not have been there to start with. For a long time coding standards have been treated with an attitude similar to "health and safety gone mad!" variety.  We are talking about code, which can work efficiently, or not efficiently.  If the latter, it will come and bite you on the behind at some point.   Standards exist to provide firm foundation for web development and the way data is handled.   Youthful impatience is acceptable, but those from my own age group often produce the same whine, whenever standards are mentioned.  To them I remind them of the old adage (that should have sunk in by now)  ....
