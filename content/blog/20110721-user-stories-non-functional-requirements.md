# User Stories & Non-functional Requirements

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/07/nonfunct.jpg)There has been some interesting discussions around User Stories on linkedin recently - and have illicted some passionate opinions on why people think user stories are not enough for every requirement. Take performance or technical requirements. This is too simplistic a view on user stories - I would challeneg anyone to find a requirement that cannot be traced back to user/action(s)/results. It does require a different mindset, which I think is why there is resistance to change. 

  * Non-functional requirements are generally “hiding” in a User Story
  * We have to learn how to include non-functional requirement as a User Story
  * We have to learn how to create acceptance criteria to support a non-functional User Story
Seems straightforward, doesnt it? Well it isnt - but then requirements gathering shouldnt be - its a key stage in the beginnings of a project, and there should be a blood/sweat/tears element. 

> When a product owner says “this system must perform adequately with 100,000 concurrent users” the product owner is putting a constraint on the development team. The product owner is effectively saying, “Develop this software any way you’d like as long as you achieve 100,000 concurrent users.” Each constraint we put on a system narrows the design choices a bit; calling these “constraints” rather than “non-functional requirements” helps us remember this.
