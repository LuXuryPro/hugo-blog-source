# Evolution of MMORPG

I am interested in the positive opinions on the evolution of MMORPG's, which get closer to drawing the person further into a more complete virtual existence. Second Life is a good indication of the ultimate direction of thse types of games. I welcome the concept of an effective virtual life and real life. Asides from obvious negative implications of this new way of life, I wanted to gather some opinions on the positives of this parallel living existence, or indeed a merging of the two.
