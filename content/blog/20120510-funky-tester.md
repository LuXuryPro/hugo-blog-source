# Funky tester

People getting into testing now, are having an easier job - not least because there is a lot more discussion and information around the benefits of testing. And a general acceptance that testing has lagged behind modern development approaches, to extent it was covered in other ways. Newbies to testing are treating testing like a new playground. But the only thing that really changed is the attitude to testing, and testers in particular. Evolvement of testing approach happens because of history and learning, not because some marketing company has decided to "jazz it up". People are bouncing around the web, with their online funky tester personas. My fear is we will end up with our own version of the (now debunked) "brogrammer", which now seems like a label of embarrassment. The main protagonists of the term come across like spoilt sexist brats ([see recent debacle caused by Sqoot](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/03/how-casual-sexism-put-sqoot-in.php)). It is generally recognised that certain personality traits are more given to being a programmer, and the same is true of a tester. But to specify a personality that fits with the ideal brogrammer is pointless fluff. ![Reality Check](/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/reality_check1-300x246.jpg) While I am enjoying the surge of positive testing attitudes and discussions, I cringe at the impression some give that testers are some kind of Wild West gunslingers. Testing is entrenched in the programming world - it's not life-endangering heroism. This is also another example of US attitude, than doesn't really carry across well to UK. I like the US vibe, the ultra-positivity, the focus on "the team" and valuing all individuals within it. Only in US could there be an attempt at [a film that made dustbin men look cool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_at_Work_\(film\)) (with Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez). There is a very telling quote from Emilio Estevez, in response to people who claimed it was the funniest movie they ever saw. 

> People come up to me on the street and say, _Men at Work_ is the funniest movie I ever saw in my life. But, you know, I do have to question how many movies these people have seen.

There is a parallel there - for example, a lot of people, previously uninterested in project process, gravitated towards Agile. The language used to describe it was aimed at everyone, not just technical people. It's focus communication and individuals was very appealing (though implementation was deceptively harder). The recent surge of use of brogrammer highlights more attempts to make IT cooler than it actually is. In fact, the people who deserve the moniker of "brogrammer", are largely morons. We made a similar judgement error in attempts to adopt  Japan-originated approaches such as Scrum and Lean - approaches that are developed are specific to a country's work culture.  I can really only judge from UK perspective, and we still have a transparency issues (actually, should I just call it honesty issues?).  But I do know that modern development approaches like Agile and Lean, are at odds with the UK work culture, but probably not so with the US.  Transparency is oft-used word, but rarely applied, due to blame-culture paranoia still prevalent in business world (yes, even in an oh-so-trendy start-up). The question for those of us who remember worse days in testing world, is have things improved? I don't mean perception of testing, I mean has actual testing process improved? Well, largely yes - thanks in no small way to progress of test automation and the demands that Agile placed on testers, previously only used to manual testing, when nothing else expected from them outside the basic testing/reporting role. Interest in testing 5 years ago was primarily in the perceived ease at which is what to bluff your way in. If you had an ISEB certificate in your hand, it made the process even easier. So before we get ahead of ourselves, and dissolve into pantomime-levels of the testing experience, we should just be grateful that testing is back where it belongs. In fact, it is now further ingrained into the project process, and in unique position to spread influence through the project. [Rapid Software Testing(RST)](http://www.satisfice.com/info_rst.shtml) and [Context-driven testing](http://context-driven-testing.com/), though popular, are not global takeovers. And nor should they be – or they will follow the battered path of Agile. Any improvement to testing process, are result of ongoing learning continuum in all areas of projects. For example, check out this testing approach document from 1997 - obviously created for step-down projects, but the principles therein are still sound. I appreciate these are a few real modern efforts to redefine what testers should be doing in modern development world. We always have to be careful when introducing new terminology. When you try to define a generic approach, it is always at risk of misinterpretation or even worse, it becomes just another vacant buzz-phrase. An important point to highlight is “Rapid Software testing” is not “new”, more a result of a culmination of years (decades) of experience in testing world (“Standing on the shoulders of giants …”). Importantly both RST and Context-driven testing can be adapted for different project environments. One of the Context-driven testing principles that rings very true, and is rightly the first one outlined ...
