# Trepanning

![Amanda2](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/Amanda2.jpg)After a particularly long session in front on the laptop, trying to multi-task servers and development tasks (always a brain burner for the male),  this striking image came to mind, which I saw a few weeks ago  - Amanda Fielding, an artist who I read was a fan of [trepanning](http://www.noah.org/trepan/people_with_holes_in_their_heads.html), to extent of filming doing the procedure on herself, and videoing it.  She used a dentist drill, but did not make the process seem anymore appealing.  When I am working too long on all cylinders, my brain starts to feel like it swelling up like a football, and although the smart part of my brain says what madness it is, the other thinks wouldnt it be nice if it was that easy to relieve pressure! ![trepanationgame](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/trepanationgame-150x126.jpg)

> The founder of the trepanation movement is a Dutch savant, Dr Bart Hughes. In 1962 he made a discovery which his followers proclaim as the most significant in modern times. One's state and degree of consciousness, he realized, are related to the volume of blood in the brain. According to his theory of evolution, the adoption of an upright stance brought certain benefits to the human race, but it caused the flow of blood through the head to be limited by gravity, thus reducing the range of human consciousness. Certain parts of the brain ceased or reduced their functions while others, particularly those parts relating to speech and reasoning, became emphasized in compensation.
