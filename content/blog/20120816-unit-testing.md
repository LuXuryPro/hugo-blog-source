# (U)n(I)t Testing

I used to think companies who advertised for unit testers, had developers who couldn't be bothered with them, and managed to convince someone it was a testers job anyway. Fast forward, and now it seems the lines are blurring. I'm recently seeing adoption of a more unit testing style of developing test automation scripts.  For web application testing, even better if those tests can be run in headless browser.  So instead of simply thinking about the end to end test, also think about how to break it down for reusable components.  Tester and Developer roles are getting irrevocably closer together. Testers can design these tests, before there is actual code to test ... its called BDD ;) And given the DSL/DSM  direction of development, it seems testers will be more future-proof than developers.
