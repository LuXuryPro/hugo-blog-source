# User Stories And Adaptive planning

![adpative_planning1](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/uploads/adpative_planning1-150x150.jpg)In true Agile, test are written concurrently with user stories.  This has two-fold benefit for early development and test planning (accounting for testing is one of the biggest failures in project planning).  The user story should not be too broad but also not too specific either - that is where the skills comes in.  A general guide is that you should be able to explain a user story in about 30 seconds.  From these user stories, all projects members can gain an image of what an application can look like and do. Anopther primary reason for Agile implementation failure, is for development to remeber one of the Agile principles is correlating functionality with business logic (i.e. requirements).  By working to user stories, the end goal is always visible and in focus.  Other project members can quickly see overall progress in real-world terms.  Though perhaps oversimplifying the general format of user stories is:- As (**user**) I want to do (**this**) like (**that**) OR As (**user**) I want (**this**) to behave like (**that**) Adopting an effective user stories strategy will help with longer term planning, and flag up potential problems before implemented in code.
