# Grass growing beneath our feet

We are not questioning enough, which is why a web sub-culture has built up beneath our feet. While we visit the web, they occupy it as an integral part of their lives, no, existence. I am putting aside the teenage commonplace problems such as destruction with no purpose - the "I dunno". This sub-culture is most prevalent amongst the under-25's but by no means exclusive to that group. Some have embraced the web to launch their inner angels/demons. Some are called [dramawhores](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drama%20whores), which as you can probably guess, means those who will do anything to seek attention. That word sounds like it came straight out of [Girls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_\(TV_series\)) TV show. 

> [Drama Whore] A person, male or female; who sees any aspect of their personality or actions in their life as interesting topics. Often the drama whore will send out messages with absolutely no content except for something inflammatory or retaliatory directed at another person(s) they dislike.

It is unsurprisingly how this sub-culture has grown so rapidly, as it has done completely out of view.  The very public and sometimes questionable activity of Anonymous has brought it more to the surface, and hacker world is tied into this wild-west sub-culture, quite naturally.  The laws are, there are no laws.  A kind of anarchy prevails, with posse mentality to retribution, sometimes just based on matters of opinions, rather than real moral outrage.  Your little angel of a teenager, could actually be an online demon - trolling transexuals, hacking facebook accounts and uploading porn, DoS attack on a website for the hell of it. You just don't know unless you look.  And as a parent I would advise you do - I am finding it fascinating and educational.  It is the seed of something a lot more interesting, if a little chaotic at present.  You will find lots to shock you, just don't torture yourself with it.  There is plenty of other genuinely interesting or bizarre places to visit.  I will do another post soon reviewing a few.  And access using an anonymous proxy - just common sense protection, as it's a world where anonymity is prized (unless you are a "dramawhore" of course!). It annoys me how little questioning there is generally over hacker activities. Too many adopt a scatter-gun approach with no defined targets beyond bringing down servers. With most, it is a young innocence about the cause/effect of their acts of online bravado. From intentions of being the moral rebellion, can quickly fall into category of aimless vandalism. The equivalent of simply shouting at the world, without expecting response. When questioned, most will ignore you, but some will surprise you. There is a  "causalities of war" mentality to effects on individuals, but if you highlight an individual case it can sometimes make people look at their morality a little differently. If adopting a "war is war" mentality, then you have to be very certain of your goals, or the effect of your activity will be pretty meaningless. The web is perfect platform for opinions, and excellent chance for cross-generational dialog, but it is underused.  The generation gap appears even worse online, and I believe old-fashioned etiquettes still exist in older generations that should be ceremonially dumped.  If you saw a kid smashing bottles, you would tell them to pack it in.  Exactly the same online. Exactly. Just keep the conversations publicly viewable, that is very important if you hope to come across as genuine and encourage others to contribute to your arguments.

The web is a very judgemental world, so opinions are many and various.  But very little from generations over 30. We should change that.
