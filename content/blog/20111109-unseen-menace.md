# Unseen menace

Business is still approaching Agile all wrong - and we in QA should be helping them to understand. Problems derive from too much immersion in software development methodologies. In fact, the business should remain largely disinterested in the actual techniques used, and more about project initiation and requirements, and expectations on reporting and exit criteria. As a businessman, do you really care if the development team are using TDD, BDD or Kanban? Or what test automation tools are being used? As long as the goal is reached, and the business has the transparency on progress, the business does not need to go into the granularity of development methodologies.  It is a classic mistake - a company executive gets sold on the buzz of Agile, then proceeds to make random and frequent assertions how "we should all be working Agile". Then the various projects implement various attempts at Agile (generally Scrum-type arrangement). Developers in this situation, tend to work just as they did before, as they are assumed to be "Agile" to start with. This leads to disapragy among projects within the same company - all with differing levels of transparency, devleopment quality and reporting styles. This isn't Agile - it's intigated chaos. Then the business will suddenly decide "Agile isn't working", and so dampen the spirits of the project teams who were simply attempting to please the masters. And too often, business managers get involved in decisions such as test automation and exploratory testing, with no background - they make decisions purely based on their perceptions of the value of these things. The right way? Business takes a step back and examines their own processes of project initiation and follow-through. This provides a framework to deliver requirements to a project team, and defined guideleines on updates, reporting and exit criteria. This is the level that business need to operate at. Product Owners are there to represent business interests, so select one you can trust to get on with it. Its is same principle as when outsourcing - why pay for outsourcers you don't trust and have to monitor all the time. Like you are their nanny. If you don't trust the project process to deliver your products, then why not change the entry and exit points - that is ultimately what the business control on a project.
