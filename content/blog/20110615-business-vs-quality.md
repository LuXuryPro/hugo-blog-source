# Business vs Quality

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/Quality_Assurance.png)Interesting that after linkedin discussion around [Test Assurance](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Test-Assurance-3926259), I notice the word "assurance" used a lot in business, especially in finance which as a business, is centered around client confidence. It is easier to see the problems around Test Assurance on IT project in context of finance industry, as so much of the business is centered around assurance. Deadlines in finance projects are usually agressive by default, and although this can help project momentum can also become a negative force. The gulf between business and IT is still significant in terms of expectations, and a lot can be put down to amount of business involvement and understanding. Agile does attempt to address this, but as with any methodology, there has to be a buy-in into the process. 

> Test Assurance critiques your test approach for suitability and effectiveness. At the project initiation stage itâ€™s a form of insurance, supporting the identification and application of the most appropriate testing approach. Test Assurance provides a subjective view with direct feedback to stakeholders and is totally independent from the delivery of the project.

Too often, I see the project business representative turning into a project manager - unhealthy, as business drivers are largely in terms of short-term successes, rather than long-term goals. Not their fault - weaknesses in the application of Agile allow this to happen. A strong Scrummaster can avoid this pitfall, by ensuring Quality Assurance measures are in place - the most appropriate area to deliver results to the stakeholders. This goes some way to addressing weaknesses that Test Assurance intends to identify and avoid.
