# Protect us from pointless causes

![19a-17_woman-big415](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/19a-17_woman-big415-150x144.jpg)I am getting a little sick of people chasing ridiculous rights.  Though obhorrent to be beaten up for being fat (though i agree with comments that there is probably more to this story - bleedin' media!), running a campaign to follow a US city's example, and introducing ludicrous rules to accommodate fat people is way overboard.  Medical conditions aside (and they are a very small percentage), being fat is result of not moving around enough to shift the calories you are intaking.  And these fat grown-ups are unfortunately producing fat children (who are subjected to the same poor diet, and lack of movement)  My favourite comment on this story sums it up for me ... “You have the right to be fat, the right to be sick, depressed and unhappy. You don't need a law to do that. The question is why would you want to be?” MF, London To suggest that restaurants, pubs clubs are obligated to accommodate obese people is a very sad joke.  The abuse is disgusting, but I am the same as most people on the tubes in the morning - ocassionally cursing the person who takes up 3 peoples worth of space.  Instead of putting so much energy fighting for your rights, put that effort into not being fat - it is unhealthy you know!
