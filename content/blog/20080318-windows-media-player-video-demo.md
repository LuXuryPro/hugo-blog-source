# Windows Media Player Video Demo

Browser Support: 

  * Internet Explorer 6+/7
  * Firefox 2+ - (Some features, such as "Autostart", will not work)  
There is currently no support for embedded Windows Media Player for MAC browsers, but other players are supported for MAC (such as Flash or Real Player).  It is normal practice to supply at least two different format choices, to increase the range of browser support.  Flash is the most popular choice, as it has the most extensive browser support. 

##### Embedded Windows Media Player Video

Video Formats Supported : mpeg1, mpeg2, avi, asx, wmv, asf
