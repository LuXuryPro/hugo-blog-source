# Reverse engineering requirements

One of the great challenges of modern development projects is the phenomena that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago, which is very real possibility of little/no business requirements, or very out-of-date requirements.Â Â Generally, once a project reaches development phase, most methodologies will assume requirements are in place. If they are not in place, then there will be some kind of development requirements.Â While these are sufficient to develop software, they are notÂ sufficient to deliver software to a customer.Â In these circumstances, reverse enginnering requirements can help solve the issue. No-one wants to go backwards, butÂ sometimes it is a necessary evil.Â In my QA manager capacity, I have seen this situation many times.Â The way to reverse engineer requirements, by stealth,Â is a combination of:- 1\. Get the customer more involved in the test cycle (so they can realise what their requirements are) 2\. Generate some standard business requirements based on generic software standards. 3\. Generate some standard business requirements based on conversations. 4\. Use higher level development requirements. Once you have a baseline set of business requirements, you can then put them forward for review.
