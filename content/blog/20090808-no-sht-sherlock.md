# No Sh*t Sherlock!

> The media and telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, examined the most popular broadband product advertised as offering speeds of "up to" 8 megabits per second and used by 57% of homes. The report, published today, says, on average, users are getting speeds of just 3.9Mb. That means a DVD-quality film would take more than two hours to download - longer than it takes to watch it - compared to just over an hour at the faster speed.

I despair of any regulation in this country - this sort of report was out 8/9 years ago - basically broadband providors advertise and charge for a POSSIBLE connection speed, not reality. The providers could dress up many excuses for this, but fundamentally they are lying - in advertising and charges based on mythical figures. This report also summarises the major providers real average connection speeds ...

ISP and package Average speed AOL Broadband ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 3.3 to 3.9Mbit/s BT ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 3.8 to 4.2Mbit/s O2 ('up to' 8Mbit/s)* 4.1 to 5.1Mbit/s Orange ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 3.8 to 4.5Mbit/s Plusnet ('up to' 8Mbit/s)* 3.8 to 4.9Mbit/s Sky ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 4.0 to 4.7Mbit/s Talk Talk ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 3.8 to 4.6Mbit/s Tiscali ('up to' 8Mbit/s) 3.2 to 3.7Mbit/s Virgin Media('up to' 10Mbit/s) 8.1 to 8.7Mbit/s

This kind of false dishonest service has become endemic to UK, as we are used to being ripped off by successive governments, and English nature is still very much to accept and adapt (our biggest strength, and weakness). Governments and companies exploit this nature, but has now got to point where customers should revolt. One easy effective means is to formally dump your provider, and challenge them to take you to court. If you are feeling adventurous, take them to court before they take you. Either way, they will find it hard to prove anything other than that they are yet another conning corporation, which acts ad if the consumer are their money-making toys. Don't let them get away with it.
