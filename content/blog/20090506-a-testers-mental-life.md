# A Testers Mental Life

### [Beizer’s Phases in a Tester’s Mental Life](http://epic.onion.it/workshops/w06/slides01/tsld007.htm)

From 1998, but still hold true for any tester - we start off full o' beans and anxious to prove things are OK, and our brain can onyl function in a class-oriented way (that's programming class!). Then we quickly realise there is more value in finding weaknesses. Then once the obsessive behaviour finding errors comes to end, due to realisation that chase for perfection is a fruitless one, we end up prioritising problems we find. This issue needs resolving now, but this one can be done some time in the future. The final phase is most valuable of tester - testing is a discipline, its an approach, its a way to integrate QA into a project and moving beyond simply being someone who reports a bug. As a discipline a tester should not only be rasing bugs, they should be reporting improvements, possible requirements errors, and becoming a focal point of information for what does work and what doesnt work, and what needs fixing when. 

  * Phase 0 = There’s no difference between testing and debugging. Other than in support of debugging, testing has no purpose.
  * Phase 1 = The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.
  * Phase 2 = The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn’t works.
  * Phase 3 = The purpose of testing is not to prove anything, but to reduce the perceived risk of not working to an acceptable value.
  * Phase 4 = Testing is not an act. It is a mental discipline that result in low-risk software without much testing effort.
