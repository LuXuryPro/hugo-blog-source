# World Usability Day

![world](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/world-128x150.jpg)Human Factors International are running an essay competition, with a hard topic - _How can the User Experience Community support the future of sustainability?_ My definition of User Experience may vary from others, as there are a lot of differing opinions as to aims and scope.  This highlights the importance of the user experience, and as everyone sees the world a little differently to each other.  But I believe in keeping things simple - User Experience incoroporates the design and functionality heuristics of a website.  Pandering to users can be a disaster, so it is a fine line between Good/Bad User Experience.   The "customer is always right" can be disasterous in software development.  Just because someone knows what they want, it doesnt mean it is what they need, or indeed if they actually want it!  How it can affect sustainability is a very (deliberate, I'm sure) open question.
