> *Big data is a popular term used to describe the exponential growth, availability and use of information, both structured and unstructured. [Big Data â€“ What Is It?](http://www.sas.com/big-data/index.html)

Unstructured is probably an understatement - it's quality not quantity. It's only sales and advertsing who wet their pants with excitement with vast majority of Big Data, as the majority of Big Data is garbage only on use to sales and marketing. On social networking sites for example, there are plenty who will talk about themsleves and their lives to huge extent, because online, people are far less likely to tell you to shut up, unless you are offensive. Desperate is acceptable, as is boring (unless you are a teenager). Social networking has become a effort-whirlpool - I update LinkedIn and Twitter, but even that seems like too much effort. For all the sell of social networking, what does it really do anymore, apart from giving us a different way to communicate with people. Rhetorical question. Hint: it's another way to communicate with people you know. But most people use it as platform for making statements and pointlessly filling up their timelines, avoiding waking up from a long bad dream.
