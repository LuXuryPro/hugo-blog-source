# Vodafone and Open Source

Vodafone have taken a major step forward, moving their software development into open source.Â In addition to making some of their own mobile application for download and review.Â This is a major step forward for mobile telecoms development.Â "_Vodafone Betavine is a research and development space run by Vodafone Group R&D. We aim to encourage collaboration in the area of mobile and internet communications_" - <http://www.vodafonebetavine.net> Although mobile companies have been releasing code on open source for a while now, which has assisted their development streams, this is a more valuable effort which will have a wider reach.Â Open collaboration and discussion is the way forward for software development.Â Open source has come a long way, and has spawned new software development methodologies; from Extreme programming to Agile.Â Efforts like this from Vodafone acknowledges the ways that technology companies can benefit from open source and web 2.0 ethics.
