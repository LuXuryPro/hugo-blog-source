# London Wordpress Meetup

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/05/meetup_logo_11-170x170.png)There is a new London wordpress meetup starting on 9th June. Wordpress has been in exisitence for many years now, and has built up a large following. Drupal seems to be dominating the commercial end of open source CMS's currently, but I always favoured Wordpress because of its vibe, architecture and semantic web philosophy. Wordpress is only growing, so if you have an interest in CMS in general, want some information to help you evaluate Wordpress as a solution, or simply want to meet up with other wordpress developers, drop along to this meetup.
