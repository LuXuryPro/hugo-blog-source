# "podcast" - another way to say "playlist", only more expensive

I am a real collector of social networking sites, why, I do not know but I have ended up with a set of ones I use regularly, namely delicious, tumblr, stumbleupon, reddit (such horribly designed site - I love it!), vodpod, etc .. all used for different purposes. Collecting audio has been more challenging as 95% of audio bookmarking sites are music-related, and I was more interested in other audio - presentations, comedy, lectures ....  and due to another Apple smokescreen of "podcasting", means most sites that offering these types of audio adopt the "podcasting" terminology, and either have such restrictive functionality makes it boring, or have the cheek to charge for basically being able to bookmark and upload your own "podcasts".  For podcast, read f*cking audio file! The same way the iPod/iTunes turned a simple concept of hard drive, sound module and player software into a song and dance of epic callous sales and marketing - but at least they are generally only ripping off idiots.  A fool and his money are indeed, soon parted. ![huffduffer](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/huffduffer-150x30.png)However, my little rant over (the mere thought of Apple causes smoke to eject from my ears), I found a nice site, [huffduffer](http://huffduffer.com), that did what I wanted.   Still adopting the "podcast" terminology, but importantly on this site, it could juts as well be called a radio station.  A simple service that allows you to bookmark mp3 files, and create essentially a playlist (or podcast if that pleases you) - whatever apple try and dominate in this area, this is still THE audio format and the most prevalent. Doubt I could describe it better than their short blurb:- 

  * Find links to audio files on the Web.
  * Huffduff the links—add them to your podcast.
  * Subscribe to podcasts of other found sounds
A well formatted RSS file, and very active community.  Still very much web 2.0 user-generated content philosophy, which is generally now slated - but is a mutually beneficial free service such a bad thing?  I could have actually created service myself, but I figure there is enough to be doing, and the web is a community after all, so support these web services.  I think we take too much for free for granted.
