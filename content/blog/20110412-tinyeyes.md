> TinyEyes will show you how a baby sees an image that you provide. Our baby-vision simulation method is based on scientific studies of infant visual perception. Please remember that this is our best scientific guess about how a baby of a particular age would see the world. There is quite a bit of individual variability, so any particular baby may see things differently.
