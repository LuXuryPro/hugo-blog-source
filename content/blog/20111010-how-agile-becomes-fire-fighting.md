# How Agile becomes fire-fighting

What is the obsession with saddling people with combined roles in Agile - and often they do not even know they have two - it's assumed. The project manager was split into two roles - Scrummaster and Product Owner. I do not believe there was anything wrong with the role of project manager, but the Agile division made sense utilizing development management skills of planning and maintaining momentum, with the (assumed) business analysis and planning skills of the Product Owner. It makes sense on paper, but with the splitting of roles, comes more risk as you have to have the right two people. Very often the Scrummaster or the Product Owner falls into project manager role, due to weakness in one or the other. In industries still early to Agile, they retain the usual Waterfall role structure, though development managers have become a rare sight. This actually doesn't have to mean a disaster - the Agile roles are still fulfilled to some degree, although the Scrummaster/Product Owners are recombined into a project manager. In those circumstances the Project Manager will have a stressful time - and highlights that there is a good reason for the PM role split. To work in a Agile fashion is more demanding on planning, and it's a bad situation if the project manager is spending 95% of his day on MSProject (or something less hideous). Even worse scenario is when the Scrummaster and Product Owner roles are "missing". Either through inexperience within the team, or people rejecting their roles by simply not performing them. Sounds strange? Look in any corporation and you will find this situation. The onus is that situation is that the developer(s) understand what is required to deliver an Agile project. But the stress this time is firmly in development camp - just the place where you not want a stress-overload. You will end up with a project that bounces around (and largely on the spot). Comining roles can sometimes be sensible business move, but in Agile the roles are seperate for a reason. Ingore them, and dont't even think "we're agile!". At best you will end up with a faster Waterfall struggle. If you are struggling to fill roles effectively, then maybe the methodology isn't for you ... not without changing your approach.
