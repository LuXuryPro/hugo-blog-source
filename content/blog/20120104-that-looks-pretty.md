# That looks pretty

Clients often take the wrong approach when specifying requirements, by using examples of what they have seen on other websites.  Hence proliferation of jQuery/AJAX madness, contradictory functionality.  Instead of thinking about what they need, they choose what they want, based on what they see on other websites.  How many times have designers heard "just make the site look like that one"?   Separating out data/functionality from design was a fundamental move in development, but clients can send this backwards latching onto design, before data and functionality considerations.  One of the more recent phenomena is the hype around HTML5 and CSS3, and the features are impressive.  They are also not supported by all browsers, and in fact there is no browser that 100% supports either of these ... yet.  So when a client starts ranting about how much they need HTML5 in site development, and pretty rounded corners, it would be a good time to remind them that not only will development time be ramped-up accommodating different browser supports, the test time is also increased as browser coverage needs to be more extensive. Time should be spent encouraging client to focus on functionality first - then get the inner machine specified.  Dressing a site up is important, but it shouldn't be driving the rest of site development.   Anyone who uses the web,. designates themselves experienced with web activity.  As a user, they rationally think, my opinion is worthwhile.  Yes it is - but their opinion on other websites is not.   Looking at a website, which you have no knowledge of the inner-workings, can inspire you and give you ideas.  But what isn't clear from the site the ideas were taken from, is how it was achieved, and if the site developers managed to do it in a clean and optimised way.  Javascript (for all it brings to front-end development) is an overhead, and it can quickly build up into a clunky, clashing nightmare. It is disappointing that this is still a severe issue in IT projects, with self-appointed experts (at sometimes a very senior level) dictating websites based on what they have been sold, and what they have seen.  It is a good idea to keep abreast of latest developments.  But if you adopt technologies too early, you will be part of a painful unofficial beta effort to get the site working on all platforms.  And even worse, it may compromise your functionality aims.
