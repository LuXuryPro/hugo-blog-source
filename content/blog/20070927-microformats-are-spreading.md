# Open Standards in Webcomics

A great definition for microformats from a web comics site ... 

> The idea, if I understand it correctly, is that the actual meaning of stuff from the Internet can be made more transparent, to other computers, by developing simple, universally-defined markers for particular kinds of content, so that, for example, when the Google searchbot comes upon a web page that also happens to be a review, or a job posting, or a resume, it can be automatically indexed as such, and made available specifically to people who are looking for reviews, or job postings, or resumes, more immediately and reliably than the usual fuzzy language interpretation that â€œintelligentâ€ searchbots try to perform today to categorize content along those lines.
