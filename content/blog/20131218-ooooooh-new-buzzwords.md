# [blank] manager

I believe the problem with the implementation of many of the software development approaches (both fashionable and unfashionable), is the focus on management over development, when applying them. This is endemic of issue with business world in general, and older concepts of management struggling with newer concepts of a different structure new development approaches demand, which relies on technical and soft skills, over line management and reporting processes. Your typical manager will struggle with no-one to manage, no-one to be responsible for in a traditional sense. Trying to be an Agile manager, without changing your approach, is one of the many reasons Agile became the pariah on many projects.  The reason Scrum did not end up in same bracket, is it could be massaged more to fit expectations of management in terms of milestones, planning and reporting.  When I was on my first BDD project, I realise how much badly applied Scrum could damage the flow of a development approach. To the point when Scrum was ditched in favour of Kanban, which presented a much more realistic picture of progress. This demonstrates the reason I have gravitated towards Lean appraoch in general - whereas Agile suggests with a nudge, Lean applies with a sledgehammer. What is important to remember with the buzzwords around areas of Agile and Lean, is they focus on developer and client.  Any other roles still have validity, but they have to change, or more accurately, adapt.  You will always need leadership of some kind, people who shoulder ultimately responsibility of delivery.  But management in general, has resisted true Agile, as there are many managers who have little skill at fundamental managing, let alone adapting to modern development approaches.  Most managers are hiding behind a shield of bluff, management-speak, or simply succeed because no-one really understands what they are managing. What defines a manager is who they manage - as a job title, "manager" is becoming increasingly vague and irrelevant.  What bugs me that the "grunt work" of any of these modern development approaches is shouldered by development and QA.  And often, we are simply pandering to management notions of progress and success, whilst beavering away in the background trying to do things right.  It's a long-overdue area of improvement, as we are still essentially playing a game with the client, and it's the management layers (on both sides) perpetuating the problem.
