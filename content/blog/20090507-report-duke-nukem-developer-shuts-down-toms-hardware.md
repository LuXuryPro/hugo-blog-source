# Duke Nukem Developer Shuts Down

A sad day, as the makers of seminal titles of Duke Nukem and the Wolfenstein 3D are folding, due to lack of funds.  Wolfenstein especially brings back many memories of long gaming sessions, and the thrill of completing the game.  At the time, it managed to achieve what other games lacked - a throughly playable and challenging game, with a goal that was just attainable enough, to avoid feeling of wanting to scratch your eyeballs out in frustration.
