# Hello Daisy

![daisy](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/189/506568660_6b0c5998fa_m.jpg) ![Daisy2](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/506568676_5edc19f1f9_m.jpg) I could be happier, but not much. A healthy and bonny baby and mother. After 39 years 3 months 12 days, I now have a true feeling of a new beginning. Thanks Daisy!Ã‚ And many thanks to Jennie and Lauren from the East Surrey Hospital for not only fabulous midwifery, but also their sense of humour and personal touch.
