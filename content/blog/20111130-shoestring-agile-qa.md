# Shoestring Agile QA

One of the off-putting factors for smaller companies implementing Agile is perceived cost and complexity. How much does is cost to implement a new process or guidelines? Well, nothing on the face of it - though there time for everyone to get up to speed, and maybe a few additional tools. Agile is a mixture of common sense and principles that have been in software engineering for decades.  In capacity as QA Manager, I have been in many companies like these - where no money really means no money! Or a heavy dependency on next round of funding. Attacking the development process is a good step - going Agile in development is half the battle, and this is an area when QA can really contribute. I am writing a guide (tentatively titled "Shoestring Agile QA") - a guide for QA Managers, Test Managers and testers, on how to use solid QA and development principles, to make a project Agile.
