# Is your website code hurting your online marketing efforts?

![standards](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2850528811_5c0c1eec10_o.gif) [Is your website code hurting your online marketing efforts?](blog.unionstreetmedia.com/technology/is-your-website-code-hurting-your-online-marketing-efforts/  ) I am always on the lookout for ways to justify coding standards, what I know most developers acknowledge coding standards are a good thing, but not if it is getting in the way of what they are required to do.  Maintaining standards after a site launch is also very difficult, but can be addressed by scripting an automatic check through online validators, then emailing on errors reported.  Regardless of website, I would expect at least compliance with Level A Web Accessibility ([WCAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)) and XHTML Transitional - this will go a long way to make a site compatible across a wdile range of devices and browsers. A little known fact is that better coded sites are ranked higher on search engines like Google, as they are easier to analyse and process. There is a w3 approved editor, [Amaya](http://www.w3.org/Amaya/), which also provides useful development environment focussed on standards compliance. The validators that are approved and highly regarded are:- Web Accessibility (Level A) : http://wave.webaim.org XHMTL Transitional (absolutely ESSNETIAL for cross-device/cross-browser compatibility) : http://validator.w3.org Broken links checker : http://validator.w3.org/checklink CSS Validation : http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ These validators are aimed HTML and CSS coders as they give the technical fix information, and some of the w3 validators will actually tidy up code for you.  So no excuses!
