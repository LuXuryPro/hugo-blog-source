# UnixTimestamp

http://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php Poor old Unix timestamp branded the next "millennium bug" - which means a lot of hysteria, and a large anti-climax.  This is mostly due to fact by 2038, the timestamp format will have outgrown 32-bit systems.  64-bit systems won't have a problem until the sun implodes (sometime in the next 5 billion to 7 billion years).
