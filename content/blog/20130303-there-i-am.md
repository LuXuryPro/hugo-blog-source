# There I am

You don't just have to rely on googlemaps and GPS to find your location - OpenLayers provides alternative to googlemaps, and has extensive JavaScript library set of functions. OpenLayers is similar to googlemaps, but is open source and free to use and customise.  One of the easy application to demonstrate the mapping and geolocation possibilities of OpenLayers is a locator. 

> OpenLayers is a pure JavaScript library for displaying map data in most modern web browsers, with no server-side dependencies. OpenLayers implements a [JavaScript API](http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/Documentation) for building rich web-based geographic applications, similar to the Google Maps APIs, with one important difference -- OpenLayers is Free Software, developed for and by the Open Source software community.
