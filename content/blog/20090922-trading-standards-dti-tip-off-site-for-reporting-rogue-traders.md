# DTI tip-off site

![ripitoff](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/09/ripitoff-150x91.jpg)The tacky (but suprisingly nice on the eye) Rip-Off Tip-Off is a website designed to enable consumers or traders to report (anonymously â€“ if they wish) rogue traders who they suspect are ripping off the public. The site also gives information about typical cons and useful hints and tips about what to look out for. Rip-Off Tip-Off is a collaboration between Trading Standards Services across the country and the Department of Trade and Industry. I dont really approve of the govenment adoption of "tell on thy neighbour" philosophy, but there are precious few ways to report scam websites, or just to complain about a service paid-for.
