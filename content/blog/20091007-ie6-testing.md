# IE6 Testing

A lot of project requirements still include Internet Explorer 6 in compatibility requirements, but unless you are running Windows OS pre-XP, there are problems installing (thanks top Microsoft's "lets make life harder" policy to software upgrades). ![ietester](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/10/ietester-300x173.png)There are simulators, but found excellent free software which does a fair job of emulation. IETester is a free WebBrowser that allows you to have the rendering and javascript engines of IE8, IE7 IE 6 and IE5.5 on Windows 7, Vista and XP, as well as the installed IE in the same process. There is alternative, running Virtual Machine ([IE6 and IE7 Running on a Single Machine](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx)) Now you can install IE7 on your main machine for development, and get all the advantages of IE7, like the RSS platform, native XMLHTTP stack, and improved security, while still running IE6 simultaneously in the VPC on the same computer. Most importantly, you don’t even have to buy an additional Windows license. The VPC image runs in a virtual machine that offers all of the functionality of a full IE6 installation without giving it any access to its host machine’s hard drive, registry, etc. You can make as many modifications as you want to the virtual machine without affecting your host installation at all.
