# I am a [blank] tester

> I am doing Lean testing.

Firstly, does it exist? Of course it does - wherever there is development, there is testing. Am I a Lean tester? Well, I can be - but that implies I can only test "Lean". It's a waste of time labeling yourself to such specific degrees, and can actually backfire on you career-wise. A tester should be able to cope with any project environment - from Agile to NoMethodology™.  Yes, even in a NoMethodology™ environment, because there are always client requirements, and always code to test. Wherever there is a development approach, then testing needs to at least factor it into the testing strategy. Although testing can operate in a methodology-agnostic fashion, it is wiser to integrate as fully as possible with development processes. How requirements are presented is neither here nor there. Whether User Story, Use Case or on the back of a beer market, requirements are measurement of success for client, and primary illustration of process. We should be aware of this, and ensure traceability from testing done to the requirements. But we can divide up test reporting into two distinct areas. 1\. Test reporting within SDLC 2\. Test reporting for management (ultimately for the client) Those the presentation of these two elements differ, the mechanics to derive them are the same.  Every user Story should be traceable to one or more unit-level tests.  And a testing framework such as Fitnesse or the newer Cucumber or Specflow, are ideal tools to enable this.  Whatever the methodology, it makes sound sense to provide central tools that enable visibility of testing and results to all levels of project members. And enabling anyone to be able to run tests at any time. Of course, if development process is atrocious, there will be a lot of failures.  But that is also what we in QA are there for - to highlight errors in process, not only in code. Oh, and the ideal [blank] would be "good" ;)
