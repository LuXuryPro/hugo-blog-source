# It's not just about testing ...

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/07/Quality_Assurance.png)What I always say to test managers (and testers, in fact) is that it’s easy to find problems, it’s easy to find failings in processes - what isn’t so easy to making suggestions to improve. This is what distinguishes a good QA, from bog-standard QA - a good QA person has ability to find issues, but also to investigate issue further, and provide development or project management with suggestions/improvements to enable them to better resolve issues. Being "voice of doom" helps no-one. You are in a company with no history of testing process. Your remit as usual is general - testing ... and anything else to do with QA you can think of. Easy to slate these companies for that kind of job spec, but in fact you will find it a breath of fresh air. This company may be bereft of budget, limited in high-level skills, and will be confused by such terms as "DBA" and "UAT", but stick with it. What they have basically given you is a green field to play in. How far you take it is up to you - but remember to introduce in timely manner. Snowball the developers with your thoughts on improvement and methodologies, and you will simply be standing proudly in front of a brick wall. Processes are important, but these people are human. You think psychology isn't part of test management, then think again. Then think some more. Now is a good time to clarify what a "Test Manager" is. Due to QA (and business) falling behind the speed of new development processes, development started to run and dictate the show. Up until the late 90's, the importance of the developer was undermined, and so this snap back in positions was inevitable (in hindsight). Now we are catching up - to find a bit of a mess. Another important point - as a test manager do not be judgemental - it sounds like a corny line, but any environment can easily be regarded as a challenge. If they think they are Agile, let them think that - i makes it easier to promote changes. You will generally find the people saying "we are Agile" are people who are not really connected with the project, and some who do not understand what Agile means. It just sounds good "We are agile" - it does sound good. Developers will give you the reality on this - it is important to connect quickly with everyone on project, just work on that "friendly professional" persona. A lot of people who started out in testing quickly dropped out when a project demanded more from a tester than just to test. Now we have companies paying good money for test managers who are prepared to test. And it's not easy - I feel lucky that my mind seems to be free to adapt to either tester or test manager mindset. They are not as far removed as you may think ... Now back to the example company - the first thing that happens is that you are briefly introduced to key people you will be dealing with. Other key people you should ensure are familiar with you network and support team. In testing, there are always, and I mean ALWAYS, support/network related issues getting in your way. Now it may sound strange to you, but seek out other testers. More than likely the company uses an in-house resource to do "casual testing" - they may hate it, and will be grateful to hand it over. What they will also give you in insight into how they have been asked to test - what was provided - how did they feed back results? This will brief you on what project managers currently expect (remember the snowball!). Forget about the chaos - your remit is to find out what has been happening to date. It doesn’t matter whether you throw out all those processes - you can learn something about the culture around projects. From this, believe or not, you will find some or part of Agile principles. Even a company failing in Agile, wants to aspire at least, so you will find nods towards certain Agile principles. The most sensitive area you will be digging in, and possibly having to highlight improvements is development. Now a developer is a creative. I don't care what you think, they are - and neither do they - care what you think. The relationship between a tester and developer is like a ... relationship :) A healthy friction exists, as there are many areas of test/development debate. A tester is geared to thinking in small components, as a developer is, but we all know that final signoff comes from the stakeholder, not the dev team and not the test team. A classic Agile error is in the varying degrees of success that SCRUM is implemented. Largely daily meetings, and not much more than that - still closer to Waterfall's milestone approach to deliveries. So get stuck into the development process, and proactively suggest testing interim builds, and documenting the system with workflows or reverse-engineered required. In this company, the development lead is the Scrummaster by default - this is why daily meetings are observed, but wait a minute, where's the Product Owner. Now this is where project managers can end up, or someone who is disinterested in anything but a finished result. If the latter, then you can be guaranteed the user stories are poor, if they exist - and most a growing cobwebs, for all the reviews they have. If you see unmaintained user stories, then it is safe bet the current version of the system does not match them.
