# Website Content Labels

For a few years, searching on the web has become a time consuming task, and recent efforts have been made to address the issue in pragmatic way.Â Rather than previous ideas aimed at more control over the web, the idea is for a voluntary self-labelling of content and search engine filters, focussed on not closing in on the web freedom, but controlling it's accessibility.Â Self-labelling entails a site declaring it's content using an a data file (usually RDF) and a HTML include reference in index page of the site.Â Additional verification from an independant body can increase your positioning in web2.0Â filtered searches.Â Innvovations like this are bringing more democracy to the web, and more efficient use of the internet.Â You can use a basic self-label service for your own site using [http://www.icra.org](http://www.icra.org/).
