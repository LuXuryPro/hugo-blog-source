# The Worlds Oldest Websites

![nexteditorbw](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/nexteditorbw-150x150.jpg)The worlds oldest website is of course, the announcement of the WWW. No longer live, a copy remains on the w3 site. [The World Wide Web project](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a largeuniverse of documents. The worlds first browser [cern.info.ch - Tim Berners-Lee's original WorldWideWeb browser](http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html) This is a list of [the first 100 domains](http://www.iwhois.com/oldest).  Interestingly, Microsoft is not on this list (Microsoft.com was not registered until 1991).  Oh for a time machine!
