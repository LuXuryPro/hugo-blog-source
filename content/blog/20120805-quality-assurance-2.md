# Quality Assurance

#### Quality Assurance is an umbrella term for all processes and activities related to project quality activities.  Testing is the most visibly used, but there are many benefits to adopting a general Quality Assurance approach to project quality; not just testing.

Too often, modern web development projects turn into runaway trains, and Quality Assurance is ideal way to get projects back on track. I can cover project management, development and testing, in the Quality Assurance evaluation. I work with firm belief in how much is possible from just better streamlining, not least giving your team room to enjoy being on a collaborative supportive project team. Developing a QA strategy is the plan for how you are going to approach project quality, and can serve as your QA framework, for business to maintain process of project initiation and reviews/reporting. Quality Assurance can be applied from project inception through to delivery. Testing can be considered the end validation of the end-to-end QA process, and what  provides the final verification of project output. Whether just a few days or a regular arrangements, please feel free to contact with no obligation, and an assurance I won't seek to make problems much larger than they actually are. Hysteria is a very effective sales tool, but morality should always start somewhere - even in business. Our approach is based on this principle, tailored to your work culture, and existing (working) processes.  For a few days consultancy I can help projects onto a better track.
