# Would you surf the web on your mobile?

There has been a long debate over the postives and negatives of mobile phone web browsing. There is still a general consensus in mobile industry, that people are not interested surfing the web on their mobile device. I do not agree with this view - I am 39, so hardly in any major marketing group, but I regularly surf the web on my e61 - purely for fun, and also for info. Would you surf the web on your mobile?
