# web xx.xx

Always funny to read people tying themselves in knots trying to give meaning to the meaningless "web 3.0". Even funnier to read people going on excitedly about semantic web and machine-friendly data. People know "semantic web" is a good thing, even when they don't understand the meaning. 

> se·man·tic [si-man-tik] –adjective 1\. of, pertaining to, or arising from the different meanings of words or other symbols: semantic change; semantic confusion. 

"Semantic web" is misleading, as "semantic" is all about words, and how words can have different meaning in different context. It is certainly included in future of the www - more intelligent searching for example. And Microformats are providing better "machine friendly" means to store and syndicate data. Maybe this is better summary - websites are getitng more intelligent, and less dependant on user prompting. Web 2.0 has left an annoying buzzword-obsession legacy. The phrase "Web 1.0" was invented AFTER web 2.0. Trying to provide an umbrella buzzword for what is happenning now is just plain lazy! And distracting. I digress ... as this video description isnt half-bad. [youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsNcjya56v8[/youtube]
