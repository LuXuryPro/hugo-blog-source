# Windoze 7 from Microsh*t

> Introducing _Windows 7_. You told us what you wanted. We listened. **...**

Maybe those under the age of 25 will fall for this usual MS meaningless rhetoric - in reality the subtext is:- 

> Introducing _Windows 7_. You told us what you wanted the last 20 years. We listened, then decided to do it the same old way anyway, and cover it up with lots of funky adverts featuring airhead Nathan Barleys.Â  And even though we admit Vista was largely sh*t, we are still charging users to upgrade/downgrade, because we can contravene basic consumer rights with impunity.

MS patched up the cracks from Vista, but yet again MS have ability to turn a high spec PC into a low-spec one, with a shoddy OS and applications.
