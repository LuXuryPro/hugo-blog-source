# Simple SEO Principles

![perfectly-optimized-page1](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/perfectly-optimized-page12-166x300.gif)Found this on the site one of my favourite usability champions, [usabilitygirl](http://usabilitygal.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/usable-seo/). Describing simple principles, such as SEO optimisation can tie you in knots. I know it annoys developers to have testers telling them how to code, but basic such as form titles, ALT tags, and coding standards in general also have affect of SEO. For me the principle is simple - you want your site to be found with a particular keyword - then use that keyword both in code and content. And dont forget that search engines prioritise, so if your desired keyword is not even in your metadata, then its not a great start!
