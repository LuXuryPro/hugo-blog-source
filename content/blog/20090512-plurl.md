# Plurk

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/05/plurk-170x170.jpg)Twitter's most comparable competitor [Plurk](http://www.plurk.com) has been languishing somewhat, though maybe harsh, as the positive is it has not become burdened down with gizmos, widgets, etc.  There are a few services using the Plurk API to generate web services such as this one.  Essentially a bookmarking tool, that uses shorted URL in posting.  Not particularly new or revolutionary, but one of the first few batch of Plurk-based services that have been coming up recently. 

> Plurl.me is a URL Shortening service, similar to Tinyurl.com. The different is that, with Plurl.me, you can post the resulting shortened URL to Plurk right from the site.

There is also handy bookmarklet tool, so you dont have to use plurl website to do this. [Plurl](http://plurl.me/)
