# Agile vs QA

I am interested in testing opinions on Agile Methodology, as I have been working in test management in these "challenging" environments for a few years now. My main issue with Agile is that the projects tend to isolate themselves from business, in mistaken belief that development "knows best". Though the software development methodologies (based largely on open source movement) are currently exciting and innovative, it's application is subject to numerous interpretations. The main error is assumption that agile is new, and it's not, and most/all of the principles are rewriting core programming principles, for modern software development demands. Would be interested to hear experiences from QA/Test people - positive and negative. I regularly find myself defining QA processes in these environments, as there are few standards from QA perspective. Â **Chris Garrett **(Blogger, Online Marketing and web development consultant) I'm not a QA/test person but I find any methodology will only work with the full buy in and communication of all the people who are (and should be) involved. Agile is fashionable, particularly in the current "everything beta, all the time" environment but it is as good to follow as any other and success will have more to do with personalities and expertise as what approach is used. Â **Cynthia J Perkins PMP** (Program Manager - Information Technology) I am not a testing expert, but I find your insights on Agile very interesting. I just started working at Klipsch (maker of speakers) and we have been asked to review the tool to perhaps use it in place of MSProject. The engineers currently use it for product roll-out. What version of Agile are you using? I have not started my research yet. Itâ€™s on my â€œto-doâ€ list. Â **Cathryn Symons** (Independent IT Project Manager) I am a project manager, and we're using agile in my current project (Scrum). We have business staff embedded in the team, which means that it hasn't become isolated from the business. However, I do see some concerns, particularly around keeping a longer term view of the entire project (as funded) rather than just the current sprint, and making sure that dependencies are clear. I'm not convinced that Agile alone is enough to manage an entire project, though can see definite advantages for the software development side. Not having to have the requirements defined in detail up front is good, and it seems to lead to far better team working between the developers and business in our case. Olivier Azeau (Engineering Project Manager at Varian Medical Systems) In his "Collaborative Software Testing" blog (link 1). Jonathan Kohl regularly writes about QA in agile environments. The "Who do we serve" couple of articles (link 2) is a must read to understand the not-so-easy position of a tester in an environment which claims to focus on testing at developer's level. As far as I am concerned, I am not a QA/Test person but I think agile methodologies are good for product quality. The tricky part for the QA/Test people is to be able to become, in some way, ubiquitous : standing beside the developer to avoid the tunneling effect of waterfall while staying in touch with the real users world. I wrote about this issue in "Every process is an iterative waterfall" (link 3).

Continuous integration, test driven development and prototyping all form an integrated part of the process. In highly complex deployment environments, you may still require a more formal integration testing. Projects which isolate themselves form the end users are not by definition Agile, as Customer involvement is a key aspect of the methodology. It sounds like the issues that you are encountering are down to the fact that traditional waterfall practices are still being used. It doesn't matter how Agile the development teams try to be, unless you have strong project management and total commitment from the business, you will fail. Things get even more interesting when you throw offshoring into the mix.

You certainly can't do it half-assed, but to get "total committment" you need everyone (from the people doing the development to the team that supports them to the business stakeholders who are paying for it) to buy in to several assumptions: 1\. That it's better to launch something that's useful than to spend time figuring out exactly what you should build and why. 2\. That your development team cost is more or less "fixed". By this I mean Agile tries to optimize the work of the development team towards maximizing the amount of working code they can produce for the amount that they're paid. This is more or less a given when you're in a corporation with programmers who are on staff, who might not be doing anything productive for the organization if they're not focused on developing the next itteration of your product. It isn't quite as much of a given when you're outsourcing your development, and even less so when you are the outsourced developer. 3\. The business stakeholders have a good reason for wanting to develop something, and have thought through the cost/benefit analysis. There are a lot of other very valid opinions about whether or not Agile is "good" or "bad". My overall judgement is that it's as good as the planning and forethought that goes into using it. In the end, it's just a methodology, and no methodology can guarantee success (no matter how strictly you follow it.) Â **Kerry Buckley** (Software developer at BT) Given that one of the principles of agile development is that "Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.", I'd suggest that the projects you've experienced weren't really agile at all. Links: â€¢Â <http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html> Â **Heath Newburn** (Product Manager, Motivational Speaker, Change Agent, QA Geek) There is a Yahoo Group on agile methodologies, it's pretty much hit or miss. The real issue is treating QA as a separte part of Agile methodologies. It has to go hand-in-hand with each cycle. Unformtunately, I haven't seen it work in any sort of scale. Â **Elisabeth Hendrickson** (Owner, Quality Tree Software, Inc. and Computer Software Consultant) I'm a testing consultant who works with Agile teams. I've spoken and written a fair bit about my experiences and insights. The links I've included below go to my Google Tech Talk, my PNSQC conference paper "Agility for Testers", and a collection of writings on my blog. From my blog, you'll find links to other experts in Agile QA/Testing including Lisa Crispin, Brian Marick, and (as mentioned by Olivier earlier) Jonathan Kohl.
