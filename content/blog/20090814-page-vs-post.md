# Page vs Post

I have lost count of the amount of times I have heard Wordpress (and other "blogging" CMS's) dismissed, as they "just do blogs".   Though there is commercial sense in confusing the consumer ;) it an also prevent them discovering very good solutions to eb management problems. The crux of the argument is page vs post, and is there actually any difference between a web page and a web post. Well, yes, as they are generically different templates - and there lies the key - templates. A good CMS has a lot of flexibility in design, and full control of templates is one essential area.   There can be crossovers, so is there any real difference as far as user is concerned. The difference is blurring to point of whats the point? Post/Page, one and the same. 

> **Blog posts **are displayed by date and show on the home page of the blog (depending on the date or tag filter defined).  **Blog pages **support the same options as blog posts but do not show on the home page of the blog; instead, you must link to them directly through a blog post, a link in the sidebar, or via search results.

This quote goes some way to illustrate a proves a point - terms of posts/pages are wholly irrelevant when thinking about customisation - there are generic guides to the differences, but a website is essentially based on templates, not page/post style.  Learning to seperate out the technology and the terminology is especially relevant here.
