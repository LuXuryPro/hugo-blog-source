# A QR Code is a bar code

![](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/qr_img_large-300x300.png)

What to do with this?

A QR Code is a bar code that can be scanned by most camera phones and read using a QR Code reader. Your QR Code is essentially a link to your MoFuse mobile site. You can use this image anywhere you like, and anyone with a camera phone can take a picture of it and if they have a QR reader, they'll be sent directly to your MoFuse mobile site! _[mofuse_](http://app.mofuse.com/users/edit/12482/qrcode)
