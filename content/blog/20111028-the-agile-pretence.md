# The Agile Pretence

I recently did a session at a UKTMF event (UK Test Managers Forum) on modern practical Agile, and the dangers of following the misleading buzzwords and explanations around it. I didn't use this document in the end, though my research was great learning curve and challenged my own assumptions. Feel free to read and download - no restrictions, the web is built on constructive plagiarism after all!
