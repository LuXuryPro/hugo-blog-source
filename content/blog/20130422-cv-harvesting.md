# CV Harvesting

CV Harvesting - one of the most annoying and morally ambigious practices, employed by recruitment agencies.  Recruitment Agencies advertise vacancies that don't exist so they can acquire 100's of CV's from applicants who believe the job is real.  The agency collects or "harvests" the CV's from the Job Boards for their own use, either in promoting itself to prospective clients or simply to fill up time.   The bogus jobs are the seeds planted in Job Boards the CV's are the crop that is harvested.  While we can all understand the necessity of putting our CV out there, when looking for work.  What I personally object to is the deception, which is largely unnecessary, because on most job websites, you can upload you CV and make it public anyway.   If someone chooses not to make it public, that should be respected.  Recuritment agencies are doing far more harm to their reputations than good, but this outdated, lazy and morally suspect practices.
