[I So Wish | Making wishes that come true](http://www.isowish.com/)

Fascinates me, as I struggle to build my own popular web service, how these kind of simple sites become popular.  My first reaction to site was "You got to be kidding", but I quickly saw that most wishes were obviously real and the authors obviously had some real hope or at least desire of getting it.  Why else go to trouble of signing up on a site to record it.  My problem is that male tunnel vision which latches onto ideas of singular purpose rather than see more open interpretations.  No matter how conscious I am of that fact, it doesnt seem to help me bypass it!  I have created a lifestream service, which is free to use, but ultimately I know it is missing an angle.  Most of my efforts have motives of learning and understanding.  But I should try and expand those efforts more.
