# Hybrid theme framework

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/05/hybrid-core-logo.png)After few years of going round the houses with wordpress themes (commercial and free), and getting thoroughly sick of hearing the words "minimal", "stripped down" and "big slider!" in theme description, I decided to take a minimal stripped-down approach myself. But in a better way, which is what led me into the world of frameworks. The idea behind a theme framework is simply - there is always a lot of duplication in any theme, so why not structure a theme to be a base rather than the solution. Then build child themes (already a feature accommodated in wordpress templating system). So I have chosen [Hybrid theme framework](http://themehybrid.com), which seems to be very active, with a large amount of information and tutorials. To give myself a headstart I chose Justin Tadlock's Retro-Theme to use as a base for my attempts (though you are free to start from scratch of course - I just don't want my company site to be looking too skeletal for too long). To build on this framework principle, Justin also created Hybrid Core, which is not a theme at all in itself, it is designed so that you can create higher levels themes (i.e. your own framework, or "parent theme"). A parent theme isn’t a child theme of one of the other available hybrid themes – it is a full-blown parent theme itself, from which you can develop your own child themes. But I don't want to run before I can walk, so sticking with Hybrid Child Theme route for now. Will keep my child theme development progress up to date on this blog, and will be releasing it upon completion. The WP/Hybrid community have given me so much, it would seem churlish not to.
