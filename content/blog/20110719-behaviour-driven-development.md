# Behaviour Driven Development

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/07/behavior_driven_development_loop.jpg)Following recent experience with Agile Methodology BDD - I was impressed by how this appraoch provided tighter bond between user story and resulting code.  And with maintenance in mind - every time a new story added or amended, these changes propogate down through to source code level.  BDD also provides the clear scope for testing, and by using scenrarios as basis for a complete regression test set.  A lot in Agile is relaint on the quality of User Stories (as in fact any methodology is reliant on quality of requirements).  The BDD approach does ensure that user Stories are firmly in forefront of the SDLC. Once a user story is defined, should we assume that is final and that if issues occur outside of its borders, they should be ignored? Test planning based on user stories is a constantly evolving documentation - only through continued development and testing is some issues arrive that weren't considered in original scope. That is normal. Exploratory testing aims to catch these type of issues before they cause endemic problems in the system. What the stakeholder wants is important - but they are not going to be impressed by pedantic attitude of "well, you asked for it, so you got it". To test firmly within boundaries is a risky business, becasue you are making dangerous assumption on the quality of user stories/requirements. I was always taught that you test requirements too. And you raise bugs against them if necessary, which in the days when business anaylsts were commonplace, was standard practice. BDD (Behavior Driven Development) tools such as http://www.specflow.org, and Cucumber can help with exploratory testing, as with these tools, the person designing user stories will be more conscious of the requirement to code flow. BDD approach helps avoid the need for out-of-scope exploratory testing, as outside case scenarios can be addressed and included in earlier stages. The creator will be more aware of cases outside of their scenarios, as code generated can be reviewed as user stories as worked on. These tools encourage earlier reivew between analysis and development, but generating pseudo code based on user story input (which of course means requirement to code is traceable and more likely to be accurate to begin with. There is an overhead in planning/design stages, but less issues will be result. These tools developed from lessons learnt in Agile - the path from user story to code must be smooth and efficient, and if the user stories are properly integrated into the SDLC, then less basic mistakes will happen. In specflow, this is how a user story is defined and broken down into scenario (which is turn can have 1 or more scenario outlines). This is nothing new fundamentally, but because the BDD workflow focus is heavily on the user story -> coding path. A major area of failure. User story for a user dashboard, using Specflow's BDD approach (the tables are decision tables - identifying test data prerequistes, and also examples of input/output). Feature: Status Lights In order to quickly view Section status As Client User I want a traffic lights type system to represent Section statuses Background: Given I am logged in as valid user And I am on Homepage And there are Sections and Sub-sections following the criteria in table below | Type | Status | Worfklow | | Sub-section | grey | Sub-section should be marked as no longer applicable | | Sub-section | grey | Section marked as no longer applicable | | Sub-section | tick | Final step in workflow has been signed off | | Sub-section | green | Final step not signed off, and due date > 30 days away | | Sub-section | Amber | Final step not signed off, and due date 7 days away | | Sub-section | Red | Final step not signed off and due date 30 days away | | Section | Amber | Step not signed off and due date 7 days away | | Section | Red | Steps not signed off and due date <= 7 days away | | Section | Red | Steps not signed off and due date already passed | @StatusLights Scenario: Status Lights Given has Section(s) in various statuses And I am logged in as preparer or reviewer When I view Company Status Then Company Status displays according the Section(s) status @StatusLightsChangeCompany Scenario Outline: Company Status Lights Change Given A Section contains "" And Section has "" at either Sub-section or Section workflow status When I view Company status Then Company Status displays the lowest "" of "" of any Section Examples: | Status | Rank | | Red | 0 | | Grey | 1 | | Amber | 2 | | Green | 3 | | Tick | 4 | @StatusLightsChangeSection Scenario Outline: Section Status Lights Change Given A Sub-section contains "" And Sub-section has "" When I view Section status Then Section Status displays the lowest "" of "" of any Sub-section Examples: | Status | Rank | | Red | 0 | | Grey | 1 | | Amber | 2 | | Green | 3 | | Tick | 4 |
