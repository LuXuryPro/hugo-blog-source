# Its Agile, innit

Behind every methodology is 1000's of opinions of what the soundbites mean. Agile is self-explanatory to a degree - but only if taken in context. Product owners love it, as they can use those soundbites for easy justification of any requirements adding/amending. "Hey, its agile". Changing or adding requirements at any stage of the lifecycle is part of agile ethos - but all is reviewed and sometimes, rightly, rejected.Â  Its not a a demand-cycle, its a suggestion cycle. There is an inherent danger with the product manager role - especially if its the company owner takes it. I am not sure if this is blanket rule, but it does strike me as dangerous to hv such pivotal role in hands of someone who is thinking mainly about the next client demo
