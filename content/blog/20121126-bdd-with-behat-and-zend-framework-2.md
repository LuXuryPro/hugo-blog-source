# BDD with Behat and Zend Framework 2

> By the end of this presentation, you'll understand the heart of Behat: how to install it, what it does, and how to use it.

Useful demonstration of using Behat with Zend, which increased Behat's extensibility. As with anything to do with Behat, it's refreshing simple setup. For the actuall Behat/Zend integration tutorial, jump to "Act 5", which is about 75% into the presentation.
