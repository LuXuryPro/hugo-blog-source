# Out with the old, in with something ... different

Part of human nature, in fact all animals, is the young usurping the older generation. That is natural. What is important in tech context, is how we make that healthy natural process less “primitive”, as it is ultimately to our advantages to have new thinking. The younger generation, in their more clunky fashion, will use emotive language, to force points: “Old is bad, new is good!”. Fresh young thinking is good, when tempered with older experience, i.e. it doesn’t have to be war. Also, there is no rulebook that says older generations can’t have new ideas.
