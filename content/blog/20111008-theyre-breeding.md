# They're breeding!

Oh no, I have been sucked into another methodology. Its painful, but realsing very necessary to pay attention to them. Why? Because their origin began with one person deciding there was a better way to do or improve something. And if someone has taken the time to research, define and promote methodology, it warrants at least investigation. Kanban does plug a few holes that can arise in Scrum (not because of Scrum). Overloading Sprints is common problems. You can plan, you can create Sprint ToDos, but if the planning for some reason hasn't taken into account problems (that only can be seen in hindsight), the Sprint won't complete as planned. Failing to see it was not necessarily an error, its just an assumption made in Scrum that one Sprint is defined - that's final. Kanban (as with Scrum) has it's origins in manufacturing, rather than IT. But that is logical as manufacturing process is constantly re-evaluated for efficiency from product design through to delivery to customer delivery. A classic example is the bread truck. Here drivers follow a fixed route from store to store. They have a supply of bakery items in their truck. At each stop, they examine the stock and replenish what has been sold. Kanban introduces concept of making ToDo assignment planning flexible. To adjust current and future Sprints, to whatever condition demanded it. Now the first question came to mind, was about the stakeholder, and what they expect to see from a Sprint in a demo. That's why you should embed kanban in Scrum, not in isolation. I can see it working in some conditions on it's own - a web application re-factoring project for example. Kanban directly addresses a development planning problem, not a project management one. As a development planning methodology, it works well for development as eases pressures to sometimes cut corners, in order to meet deadlines. You will end up with cleaner Sprints, and less of a snowballing spillover. Just another reason why you should be slave to one methodology, as you can design one yourself based on the ideals for your project. There no is holy grail of methodologies - it defies logic.
