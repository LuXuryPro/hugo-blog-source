# Web 2.0 critic Keen says professionals will reclaim Web 3.0

Andrew Keen, who argued in his book Cult of the Amateur that Web 2.0 is destroying our culture, was more optimistic about the future when he spoke at the launch of Chales Leadbeater's book We-Think at NESTA on March 3 2008. He said:  
"The reality is that web 3.0 is actually going to be a moment when the experts, professionals, grab back the levers of power, the tools of creativity. When I wrote my book I was fearful that the masses were taking over and the future of the world was wikipedia. I actually think that the future of the world are professionals, doctors, academics, even politicians who will use the tools of the Internet like anybody else to distribute their wisdom and exertise. So I'm actually much less pessimistic in the way I look at the world about the future."
