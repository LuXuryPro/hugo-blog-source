# Modernizer

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/05/modernizer2.png)

> Modernizr is a small and simple JavaScript library that helps you take advantage of emerging web technologies (CSS3, HTML 5) while still maintaining a fine level of control over older browsers that may not yet support these new technologies.

I found this useful, as there are a lot of CSS3 design features that are hard to ignore - achieving rounded corners with [border-radius](http://www.zenelements.com/blog/css3-border-radius-rounded-corners/) is just furthering efforts to avoid loading images to achieve smoother design. Also supported are HTML5 elements, which is currently supported in Firefox and Chrome (though not completely yet). Just upload to your scripts folder and ass script call to **_modernizr-1.7.min.js_** in the section. Then have a look at the [features supported](http://www.modernizr.com/docs/#s2).
