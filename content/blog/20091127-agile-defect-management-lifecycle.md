# Agile Defect Management Lifecycle

![Issue Trackingv12](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/Issue-Trackingv12-204x300.png)I struggled to find anything close to an Agile/SCRUM defect management cycle diagram, so have done one (click on thumbnail to see large version). What struck me as I was doing this, is it was largely no different to any other defect management lifecycle.  Just substitute the following. 

  * Scrummaster=Project Manager
  * Product Owner=Client
  * User Story=Requirement/Use Case
  * Sprint=Release
The only addition I have made,  as it seems to be forgotten in most modern methodologies,  is the test manager role.   Developers need managing so it seems a little odd that it is assumed testers are basically just "developer pets", according to Agile/SCRUM.   Not so - testers should have an impartiality, not be totally lost in same world as development.   I could be harsh here, and say that Agile is an excuse to get testers to do developers unit testing :) but that would be churlish!
