# Try the CSS Validator on this site

Try the [CSS Validator](http://self-storage.in/csstidy/css_optimiser.php) on this site (based on [CSSTidy](http://csstidy.sourceforge.net)) 

> CSSTidy is an opensource CSS parser and optimiser. It is available as executeable file (available for Windows, Linux and OSX) which can be controlled per command line and as PHP script (both with almost the same functionality). In opposite to most other CSS parsers, no regular expressions are used and thus CSSTidy has full CSS2 support and a higher reliability.
