# Worker over Employee

[youtube width="640" height="480"]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BAqTsdWUXY[/youtube] The first 3 minutes summarises the modern employee in a complete nutshell. Many blame companies and their culture for the stresses and futilities of modern working practices, especially in larger companies and corps. But the truth is when you release these same people into "the wild", they will behave the same. In that scenario, instead of the company though, they will start to blame each other. Sure, you may have some natural managers/leaders - but maybe you won't. While everyone wants to be treated the same, the truth is that we are not all the same. Some carry the burden of responsibility a lot better than others. Or rather, some are prepared to. There are many employees who simply drift through the work week, and happy to be that way. It is not the fault of companies, though they play upon the human beings natural appreciation of feeling self-important. It is the fault of us self-serving, self-oriented employees. How can we not be? We will have mortgage/rent to pay, possible children to feed, insurance, bills, debts. They know the company does not care if they can't make their next mortgage payment. A company could go bankrupt, an employee sacked or made redundant - there are no guarantee. Yet companies still insist selling themselves as employee-friendly. Nothing has actually changed, except the language. In some brave companies, they tried to exercise the flowery talk, with action. And guess what? Majority of employee fully took advantage of this flexible situation. Amongst the impact of such policies in a corporation, for example. 

  * Less productive (less pressure).
  * More impromptu time off (how many more relatives do you have to lose?)
  * More dentist and doctor appointment (conveniently around 2pm, so whole afternoon is wiped).
  * More self-appointed unofficial managers (ass-kissing still works).
  * More blame culture (avoiding being "found out").
  * Facebook dating discussions around someone's PC (along with acerbic photo reviews).
  * Discussion of washing machine repair nightmare plumber during project meeting(general consensus,buy a new washing machine).
  * Projects going badly, then shoved under proverbial carpet (for contract developers to come in and rescue).
  * Clique behaviour (no-one rocks the boat - a sort of ad hoc dictatorship)
Approaching improvement of the employer/employee relationship is really just about honesty. There is a dynamic that can't be avoided, which is that employer has hired employee to work, and the employee works to be paid. Short of Star Trek replicator suddenly being available, money is a life deal-breaker. In any one company, there cannot be enough roles to keep everyone happy, but there are certainly enough tasks. By moving employees round different tasks, it keeps their mind fresher and less likely to slip into a more self-serving existence. When we learn, it is an achievement all by itself. And that is one of the most important feel-good factors at work - improvement of our skills, being soft skills such as interpersonal team leadership, or picking up expertise on a new automated testing tool. As a wise man once said (in "Psycho"). 

> Money doesn't buy happiness, but it sure as hells buys off a lot of unhappiness

We need more than money incentive, basically ...
