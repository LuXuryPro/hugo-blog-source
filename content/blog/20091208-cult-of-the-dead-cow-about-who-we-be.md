# Cult of the Dead Cow

![cDc](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/0wned.png/180px-0wned.png) I remember this was one of the first sites i kept going back to.  That was 1995, and they are still here with a slighly different website, but still the same great aims.  They started in 1984 at a slaughterhouse, with aim for  "Global Domination Through Media Saturation"  -cDc and their affiliates (such as Ninja Strike Force) exercise their right to roam the web, and operate by stealth.On the subject of NSF, this splinter group enforce cDc philosophy with even more vigor, with an even more aggressive agenda. 

> You have never seen us, but you may have felt our wrath. We operate in the bitter darkness outside the known channels. We slink like cats along the fringes, spreading the power and propaganda of the Cow wherever we are. We are the most secretive agents of that cult, existing only to fight and die for its greater glory. [Ninja Strike Force](http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/nsf.html)

There is a lot of theatricals in the www underworld, and these groups are masters of web propoganda, so it is hard to know what to believe sometimes - but even in that I believe they are trying to make a point.   Although unlcear what/who their, or cDc's,  targets are (they are never specific), I sense no malice.   cDc develop and offer privacy software for free, and there is useful information advice and links on all things to do with privacy and security - they have a healthy arrogance that they are still top dog in the Hacker world -and to behonest, its hard to disagree.  But I wouldnt imagine your average facebook/hotmail/ebay web user really bothers their radar ... or who knows :) [CULT OF THE DEAD COW: About - Who We Be](http://w3.cultdeadcow.com/cms/about.html)
