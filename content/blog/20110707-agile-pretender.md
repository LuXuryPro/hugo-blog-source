# Agile pretender

The title is sometimes how I feel - I have worked in Agile projects for many years, and seen it implemented in many different ways - to varying degrees of success. I am not formally trained in Agile, but because of my development QA background, I see project processes as logic exercises - is the way we do things logical? Agile has great logic - Waterfall had logic geared to business drivers - the business expect a product that they ask for, they were not really interested in how it arrives. This is the big mistake, treating software as predictable path to the end product, based on original requirements at the beginning. This is how the Agile "chicken and pigs" analagy came about. ![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/07/080428-scrumtoon.jpg) As a testing consultant/contractor, your remit is not to shake the whole company upside down. If they think they are Agile, then they are - in their own defintion. What is better to focus on, rather than harping on about Agile principles is to improve processes. Processes may be based on methodology, but are in fact methodology-agnostic. There is no ownership of logic - you can't own a process. "Standing on the shoulders of giants" is a phrase worth remembering, as process improvments are on the back lessons learnt over the years. The Kano Analysis emthod, devides in the early 80's could be transponded onto any product, not just IT projects. Daily meetings are considered SCRUM, but arent they just a sensible idea? A lot of process is logic - and that logic is built of software engineering fundamentals. The technologies evolve by system logic doesn't change - while we are still tied to machines that only truly understand binary, we have to be wary of wheel-reinventing. It is important to consider company culture when coming in as a contract QA/Test Manager - primarily you have been hired to help, not hinder. Too often, testing is seen as an area that causes delays, and over-documentation. The primary perception should be that testing is ESSENTIAL and HELPFUL to the process. Bleating about Agile principles will simply put peoples backs up - no-one likes a whiner. Instead of dictating methodologies, examine current processes, and SUGGEST improvements - in real-life demonsrable fashion if possible. For example there may be a loose release process that works, but has loose ends. More than likely, the team would be grateful of a diagramatic representation - and within your diagram you can add steps/criteria. Getting buy-in is also critical to this activity - people generally agree with logic, but to get them to follow it, they have to feel engaged with the process. And feel the benefit. A developer will feel the benefit of a structured end to end process for issue resolution. All Agile roles will benefit from structured test reports. Agile suffered from this perception, when all Agile was trying to improve was the SDLC in relation to efficiency in devlopment, and adherence to requirements (i.e. what the cusotmer wanted), and primarily communication across the board. Waterfall was the most popular because of it's focus on milestones. Agile also has milestones, but more of them - common release (Sprint) period is 2-4 weeks, AND also daily dev->testing activity. So Agile is Waterfall with more granularity, and more focus around roles/responsibilites.
