Frustratingly true - a lot of these gripes are common sense and/or have been long known.  There are many lists like this, mostly with similar content.  I think a better guidelines to designers/developers is if you find it hard to go round your website, then your users will.  If it is an ecommerce site, simply put yourself in the users shoes, and be a consumer.  Role-playing in testing is a valuable approach as it is easy to forget during development stages.  This is the benefit of Agile/SCRUM approaches, keeping client focus, and purpose in the forefront.
