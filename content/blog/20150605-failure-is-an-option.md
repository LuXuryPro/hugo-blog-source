# Failure ... is an option

I don't judge failure harshly - if you are experimenting/aspiring then the route is paved with potential pitfalls.  BDD is based on principle of failing first.  Sometimes I repeat that fact many times, to guage how many whinces I see from senior management. If you have a team and environment that accepts that failure, then stress is lower, as all know that support is there.  Failures should not be hidden, and certianly not go unaddressed. So why is appraoch not more common on IT projects? Do people still want to be told what they want to hear?  It strikes me (and it may be a particular British issue) that most are still stuck in an era when answering questions with giving a real answer, is considered an asset. How tiresome. The era of the self-serving manager is still definitely evident.   In this work environment, making a mistake is considered a weakness to exploit. After 18 years, and 46 companies, I would like to see the back of tired old business ways.  If anything has held back IT evolution in UK, it's business and self-serving management layers.
