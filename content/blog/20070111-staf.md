# Open Source Automated Test Software

One of the most impressive uses of test tools I saw in action was the usage of open source test tool STAF (Software Test Automated Framework) in conjunction with Junit. The main advantage was that the company was able to create a very relevant load test environment, on a lower budget. It also does not require expensive hardware to run on. STAF is a load test tool primarily, and allows you to build a load test framework, and uses XML configuration files to create different test scenarios. It is very scalable, and we were able to simulate 100k transactions spread over a 2/3 day period. This is by no means to limit of the systemâ€™s capability. It requires good technical skills and buy-in from project development team, as their input and customisation work is key to successful implementation of STAF.
