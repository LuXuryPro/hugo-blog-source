# LOL @ LUL

![IMG_0380](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/IMG_0380-225x300.jpg)It looked laughable at first sight, but then it hit me - how simple, how much less hassle and adminsitration - is it really worth paying out for more stringent security, just to catch the very small minoroty on non-payers? How easy would the tube be if they adopted the simpler system, as in Brussels, where ticket buying is "voluntary". This is balanced by a very visible and proactive transport police. So the underground system is easier and safer. The UK is so obsessed with collecting money for public services, they pay through the nose for thousands of turnstiles. The brain deficiency in in LUL is large, oprated and run by surly incompetents. The tube is poular as the choices are very limited - it doesnt take a genius to run it.  Automate the tube, get rid of the turnstiles - then there would be an efficient service.  As usual, transport management are too thick and self-interested to "get it". And unions more interested in keeping pointless staff employed (even dangerously incompetent ones) that efficiency. The London Underground is an ESSENTIAL service - why is it in the hands of muppets? Whose only engineering work efforts seems to be geared to Olympics/Eurostar services, not the daily commuters. A note to Oyster users - avoid getting top-ups at counter, as I have had several instances at Parson Green, Fulham Broadway, Picadilly Circus - where the top-up I purchased did not match what I paid. i.e. there are LUL staff creaming off money. Use the machines - at least machines are more trustworthy than LUL staff, sadly.
