Testing is still seen as an easy option, an easy get-in to IT world. And everyone is an expert - when someone find a bug in software it's seen as a trophy, and a demonstration of how anyone can be a tester. Now lets take that person and get them to write an issue report, talk to developer or maybe business analyst. Its a problem, but the fix may not be so clearcut without technical or business compromises. Now the developer checks that bug report. Its overly long, with no information on environment,debug errors, screenshots. So he/she pings it back to the reporter, who is flustered by these "demands". These type of issues disappear into the ether mostly, largely down to lack of QA skills, and experience working with development and business teams. Testing like development requires methodical, non-drama approach - criticism is easy, but communicating within a project, and taking ownership of your issues is true testing. So for all those unoffocial testers out there, from the PA's to CEO's - dropping in out the sky to complain about a registration form is useful feedback, but dont think for a minute you are usurping the system in doing so, or understanding implications. Hysteria breeds panic, and panic causes chaos. Contribute, but dont get ahead of yourself either, and end up negatively impacting a project with ham-fisted approaches to problems. **from [freelanceswitch.com](http://freelanceswitch.com/freelance-freedom/freelance-freedom-41/)** ![Software Designer](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/03/softwaredesigner-440x180.jpg)
