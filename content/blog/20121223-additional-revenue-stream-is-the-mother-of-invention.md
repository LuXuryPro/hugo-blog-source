# Additional revenue stream is the mother of invention

Facebook is testing introducing of system that charges $1 in order for users to contact strangers (i.e. people not connected by friendship). LinkedIn has had this kind of service for a long while, and spamming based on this service is pretty minimal. Spamming is only really worth it if done in bulk. And at 1$ a message, that could get very expensive. I find it a kind of desperate business model, as of course there is no real value in sending a message to a stranger, apart from accommodating the one-sided objectives of person paying to contact another. For Facebook, it's a little late to be worrying about additional spam, as spamming already is prevalent in Facebook apps, all of varying quality and many with either dubious, or lazy account access requirements. What with the targeted advertising and apps intrusions, when you log in, you more than likely have many bedfellows. Always worth checking the list of apps that have access to your account. There may not be any visual clues but they have access to your account, and usually some kind of publishing rights. I am guessing that there are many movements to collect data, and enabling functional access to people accounts. What is missing is how to use this in an effective marketing fashion. And legal. Imagine in your home right now, in every cupboard and closet, there is a salesman, recording every activity in the house. They accumulate data on you from the house - it isn't being used yet, but it is collected and stored. In short, you have no privacy. This scenario would be utterly unacceptable legally, morally - plain creepy and weird. I don't think that privacy is outdated at all, it's simpler than that, the web is prevalently amoral. And it is far easier to get bothered online, than in real-life. In technology things happen without purpose, simply because they are possible. Reasons can be worked out later. That is a very teenage approach - an overenthusiastic drive easily initialised by anything new. Applying child mindset to adult problems is a very dangerous thing indeed.
