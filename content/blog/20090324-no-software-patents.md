# No Software Patents!

![](http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/images/nsp_logo.gif) Software patents would give large corporations a strategic advantage over small and medium-sized ones, and a potentially destructive weapon against open source. Those effects are explained in greater detail on other pages of this website. Less competition in the marketplace results in higher prices, which is why you would literally "get the bill" for software patents by having to pay more for software as well as for products that contain software, such as mobile telephones. Of course, that sentence was also meant figuratively, in the sense that there are various other negative effects of software patents that all of us would experience.
