# CI

Continuous integration is fast becoming a favourite buzzphrase ... unfortunately, as it creates danger of adopting in cack-handed fashion. It's not that it's difficult, but it needs to be constantly maintained to be effective. How many TDD projects have you seen when the tests languish quickly behind the coding. It's too easy to skip doing unit tests, and tempting as unless there are code reviews, the omission may not be spotted for a long time. Though there is no dependency on tools to implement CI practice, it is prudent to use one such as [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) or [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/).![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/CI-251x300.jpg)

> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily, leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/)

Continuous integration is an ongoing and rapid process. This means that teams need to be able to react quickly when a build breaks or new tests need to be built. Below are the six steps to CI success ... 1\. Use source code repository - It’s first and required step to start using continuous integration. 2\. Introduce check-in policy Check in policy may be introduced after establishing source code repository – quite easy to introduce but some effort is required to follow. Firstly it involves storing all necessary files in repository. Secondly, each developer should check-in as often as possible completed part of work. Frequently integration show problem early and either solution is easy or rollback is necessary for only small part of solution. 3\. Automate build Next step is to perform build automatically – no more than one action should be required to start it. If developer must do more things than he forgets about it or deliberately skips it to save time. Perfect solution is when after each commit build is automatically triggered. Cost of using it is very small after establishment so I strongly advice to use it in all projects. Consider using Nant, Msbuild for scripting build process and CruiseControl.Net, Microsoft Team System or Team City as Continous integration server. 4\. Create auto-deployable test environment After each build new version of binaries should be automatically deployed to test server. After each fix, the client can then verify the new version. 5\. Use code quality analysis Using code analysis is very important in big projects with many developers. It helps preserving coding conventions and constantly monitors code. 6\. Use unit tests! TDD is a time consuming practice BUT ultimately saves time and improves overall quality. There is no dependency on having CI in place for TDD, but the two have principles that go hand-in-hand. Unit tests are an area increasingly encroached on by modern testers, and as such, alleviates the administrative burden for development, of keeping tests up to date. BDD is more modern take on TDD which acknowedges the practice needs to extend beyond the development team.
