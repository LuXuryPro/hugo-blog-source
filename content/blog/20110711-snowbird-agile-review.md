# Snowbird - Agile Review

> As the Agile Manifesto approaches its 10th anniversary, SD Times is speaking to several of its authors to discuss the gathering at Snowbird, what perspective they brought to the meeting, and what they might do differently. The 12 original authors will reunite at the Agile Alliance Conference this August in Salt Lake City. The #Agile Daily

It is a seminal moment - 10 years after original Agile manifesto, and a decade of misunderstandings and wacky implementations cuminating in Agile becoming a very dirty buzzword. And 100% unfairly. Its not new behaviour, but Agile was largely used to mask chaos. And power-crazy development teams used it to push out testing and project management. Ignorance is powerful weapon - as many did not really understand the mechanics of Agile methodologies, business latched on to the actual meaning of the word - "agile" sounds goods, sounds fast, sounds competent. I am hoping that lessons have been learnt in UK especially, as our sometimes unhealthy arrogance in world of IT has led to some abysmal implementations of what is fundamentally a logical set of processes and guidelines. Having no DBA is not "Agile" - skipping unit testing is not "Agile" - having no testers is not "Agile". No-brainers you may think, but very common mindset.
