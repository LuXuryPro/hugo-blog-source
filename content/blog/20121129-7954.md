# Pointless

> Lesson to be learnt: If you took all the effort you made towards maintaining your online updates on websites in control of OTHER PEOPLE, you would have had enough time to learn to build and maintain your own website. And more data privacy.

![theshining](/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/theshining1.jpg)One thing is for sure, we will never look back on the "good old days" of web 2.0. Half-hearted semantic web. I used to maintain a ridiculous number of social network accounts - I was just trapped in multiple circular banal updates. Some of them predictably don't exist anymore. Here is/was my complete list, though only Linkedin and Twitter keep my attention these days.
