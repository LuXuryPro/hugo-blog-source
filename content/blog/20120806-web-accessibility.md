# Web Accessibility

![wcag](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/20-150x150.png)Until this becomes fully legislated, companies tend to avoid what they see as a minefield. Observing web accessibility standards not only widens your audience, it can clean up your code as devices rely on web standards being adhered to. Can anyone argue with objective of quality coding? A standard response from myself when faced with web accessibility being shoved on back-burner, which is essentially de-prioritising coding quality. Including sensible WCAG compliance element to quality process need not hamper development. Your developers should be producing quality output, not just stuff that works. As you project processes, this bad coding practice can lead to problems further down the project timeline. What seemed once a reasonable page load time can turn into an agonising one. And if page elements are not identified in code with unique id and/or name references, any web accessibility device will struggle. Watch the use of JavaScript on button, as that can also throw out a device recognition. There is a challenge in finding good designers who are also good coders. And many times, application developers tend to have front-end work bundled in with theirs. But introducing WCAG as standard check-list with each iteration (at least Level A), this can both educate development, and provide more test coverage including coding standards. This can be automated to a large degree, but visual verification is essential and pass-through with accessibility tool emulators.
