# We love change ... just not where we live

Londoners on the whole find the attitude of those who live in the countryside bizarre. How could you not embrace change? So say dwellers of a capital, which is largely a collection of villages plugged together, with each area resisting change like their lives depended on it. It's one the irritating hypocrisies of city dwellers, especially Londoners, that they assume they are more flexible and open to change than country folk, when in fact they are the same as anyone else. Once they found something that works for them, they don't want change anymore. The gentrification of Brixton and Whitechapel are good examples of misplaced arrogance over sense of ownership of an area, just because they live there. Leaving these two boroughs with inbalance of cultures and prevalent poverty is simply naive.
