# A "George Constanza" moment

Just had conversation with an recruitment agent, who was calling me to ask me how interview went yesterday (I didn't have one). For some bizarre reason, I said "it went well", struggling to remember who agent was, and what interview I was supposed to have had yesterday. I should have simply asked what the job in question was, but I instantly assumed it was belated contact about an interview, not done in recent memory. So I went into recruitment agent response autopilot, while my mind quickly whirred away in background to trawl through the possible memory omissions, on the job front.  My head was still a little fuzzy from being kept up most of the night, with 2 year-old tantrums a-go-go. So I replied to the standard questions, in response to her queries (being read off a checklist, from the sound of it). Still not having a clue what the job was at all, but obviously in IT, as she asked if the technical skills required matched mine. It was point when she said "and is the company going to extend your current contract? You said they might". Suddenly the haze started to lift a little, and I realized I hadn't missed an interview at all, and the call wasn't for me. She had called the wrong person! Played it up right out till the end, and said I would be more than happy to take the job (whatever it was, I still don't know). So she is getting back to me, after providing my feedback to the company. Then I checked further back in my emails, and found one from this lady, then it all sounded a bit familiar.  It was about an interview I hadn't actually gone to yet. So assume she had me confused with someone else, as I also remember she didn't ask my name, she just said "It's *******" in a friendly manner, like I knew her.  Anyway, I sent her an email outlining all this, and oddly enough, still haven't had response from her, wither in response to incident, or confirmation that my interview was still on. I guess I have to assume it is, and that she is too easily embarrassed.
