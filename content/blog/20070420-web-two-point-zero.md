# 2.0licious

Bizarre how sometimes in writing, along the line, you start to revise an opinion. The quote in last post has many variations, and that isnt the original one, but the one I chose to use. hmmm, still annoyed about something though. Maybe its the incessant "try this", "sign up here", the long interminably dull descriptions of what these web 2.0 sites do. What I am impressed with is how such seemingly overly basic ideas, can grow into a business of some substance. I do have my favourites in [netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), but what is the point truly of signing up for more than one social bookmarking site? There is no logic to that behaviour long-term. 

> Web 2.0 is a very loose term. It confuses people and annoys cynics in equal measure â€“ the former donâ€™t know what to make of it, while the latter think weâ€™re all destined for another dotcom crash (weâ€™re not). Yet Web 2.0 is a very real set of concepts, technologies and approaches that can make a real difference to many online businesses around the world... _http://www.internetworld.co.uk/web-2-0.html_

Maybe I rely on the search engine too much, wrongly or rightly, to feel a need for fully use social bookmarking sites. I like del.icio.us, but just for the centrally stored, and mashup-friendly Favourites alternative. I have never yet found a link on del.icious that I havent found through Google/Yahoo. Only for the very weak reason to expand your network. To truly follow semantic principle, there should be synchronicity between like-sites. If I use del.icio.us, my bookmarks should be available through any social bookmarking site, whether it is use as whole or part of the website. Open ID is one of the more intelligent solutions, and many sites have adopted its API. But feels more like a bandage, and a lot of central control, which I am not keen on. What has splintered, and signals an imminent demise of web 2.0 is failure to mashup with their own kind still a heavy dependance on user contribution, but have less and less reward for that behaviour. Social networking sites, mixing up the what had gone before. Blog has become another component, as applications do over time. Web 2.0 should also be another component - like Open Source, it has defined a new approach to developing. Not only this but 2.0, just that by itself, is becoming a term of derison, delusional derision (to be more dramatic). But who cares, that is just fashion crap, and worthless. Say anything too long, it becomes ridiculed for that fact alone. I love what's happenning out there, but feels stalled for now, but sure the next wave is coming. Or is that just my blind optimism talking. Already there are some good post-web2.0 startups, following a KIS and useful philosohpy. Here's hoping they will put the same effort interracting with each other, as they do with with the user - but I have a feeling they will be.
