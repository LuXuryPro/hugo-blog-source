# die, email, die

Asides my my token gmail address (as sites still insist on them with signups), giving up on email. Nothing good ever comes by email. Like snail mail, it's just junk, circulars, begging or simply irrelevant. I have been maintaining my jaffamonkey mail inboxes for years - mostly mass deletion and adjusting spam assassin software settings. Again. The opportunity of a lifetime will never enter an InBox, and it's a pain to maintain. The frustration is there are alternatives, but the world slow in catching up. If you just have a one-liner, why not use skype, fb message, slack, googletalk, etc. Why crank up the antiquated email form, and send and wait ... And if you email me, you may be waiting a while. I look forward to the glorious moment when email is finally defunct as communication tool.
