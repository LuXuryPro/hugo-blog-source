# Browsershots

![Browsershots](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/header.png)Browsershots offer a nice screen capture service for multiple OS/Browser compatibility tests. A little more chaotic in tryout, in that you enter URL, and load the queue page to look out for yours (amongst other submitters). There is limit of 70 screenshots per domain, before signing up is necessary - though probably worth it as that is free also!
