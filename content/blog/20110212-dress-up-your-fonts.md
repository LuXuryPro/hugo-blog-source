# Dress up your fonts

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/fonts-170x170.png)Something simple to make your site font a little more modern and smooth. Google provide ability to add free embedded fonts - they can also be purchased at a charge you want to pay. You can pay nothing, but that would be mean spirited - people do a lot of work for free in web world, myself included. Payment isnt expected but believe me, it is hoped for ;) 

### How to do it

**<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu:regular,italic,bold,bolditalic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>** Just place the above string in <HEAD> section of you header file (assuming you are still not madly using static web page). The next stage is to alter your stylesheet, for example:- 

#### **font: normal 12px/18px 'Arial', Helvetica, sans-serif;** becomes ** font: normal 12px/18px 'Ubuntu', Helvetica, sans-serif;**

Simple! (Ensure you change all CSS font definitions where you want this embedded font to appear)
