# Incremental Automation

Firstly, it is pervasive problem that too many people talking at length about Agile and testing that haven't a clue what they are on about. The invasion of fashionable buzzwords to make the mundane sound more exciting, has become a tedious norm. There is much bandying about of "Lean" recently, with no consideration of the skills required to implement such projects. That's an aside, but relevant also to automation. The word "automation" excites managers, as it implies efficiency.  What it also implies is a possible nightmare.  ![agile-is-becoming-a-dirty-word](/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/agile-is-becoming-a-dirty-word.jpg) In so many companies, I have heard people waxing eloquently on the benefits of automation, but rarely applied well in reality.  Once the automation "sell", has moved on into action, cracks can quickly appear in the resources you have on a project.  Once recent example is a project within a company championing BDD and tools, but once on the project, the reality was BDD was given up on early in the project.  So the flagship project, was simple a smoke 'n mirrors exercise, which cost the company hugely on a very important project. People can get so blinded by software tools, they easily forget their objectives when using the. Test Automation world is full of off-the-shelf products, barely finished open source products, and bewildering array of IDE plugins. What shouldn't be forgotten is it's all about code, when it comes down to it. You can write tests from scratch, in any language - build your own test framework to do regular, maintainable testing. Tools generally are there to bridge gaps in knowledge, to kick-start the objective without adding additional work. Tools should be improving a process -but that is, unfortunately, not as easy as it is sold to be. All automated testing products are guilty of over-selling the benefits of their tools, and playing down the effort required to get these tools to a place, where they are genuinely useful to the tester and indeed the rest of the team. When someone approaches test automation software, who has little experience, the assumption is that somehow it is possibly for them to test with no knowledge of either code or testing. Of course a tool means exactly that - a tool. The assumption is you know your "trade" to start with. Sure, you can use software that presents prettified acceptance test framework for client and non-tech people to run tests themselves, but that doesn't happen by magic. Tools are essential for the experienced tester, as well as an understanding of how best to use them. No point is using a great opensource test tool like QUnit, Selenium or Cucumber, if you spend most of your day administering it, and failing to use it optimally. Automation is essential, but should be introduced incrementally - as with development. Going full tilt into a complete automation suite could leave you with a large headache of maintenance, and possibly many tests either redundant or better done another way. For example, many web application tests do not need to be UI driven, and Javascript testing is a good case in point. An even bigger area for getting in a right muddle in IDE plugins, of which Visual Studio is a most risky area. Let yourself go mad of NuGet packages and before you know it, Visual Studio will be slowing to a crawl, not to mention possible integration clashes between plugins. So choose tools carefully, and be even more careful how your use them. There is no software that will do the testers job for them. And approach automation the same as development (should) do with their coding - incrementally, with clear objectives. And it makes sense to do this in parallel with development, as each other tests can be cross-functional across testing and development. As well as ensuring you are on the right track with your tests also.
