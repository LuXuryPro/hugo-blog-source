# The Spam Omelette

![Omelette 55](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/12/Omelette-55-170x109.jpg)No real big suprise to see "Pills" at the top, as Canadian Pharmacy are presently way ahead in the [spammer toplist](http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/spammers.lasso).  Also "Unsubscribe" very popular, a common spam method to encourage user to click on link in the email. Also intriguingly the word "LOB" makes it into the list - the definition on wikipedia in "Line of Business". I have switched from being irritated by this web annoyance to fascination.  I am intrigued by web outfits that seem to operate above the law and virtually untraceable.
