# SCRUM

Scrum also developed in the 80's and 90's primarily with OO development circles as a highly iterative development methodology. Scrum concentrates on the management aspects of software development, dividing development into thirty day iterations (called 'sprints') and applying closer monitoring and control with daily scrum meetings. It places much less emphasis on engineering practices and many people combine its project management approach with extreme programming's engineering practices. (XP's management practices aren't really very different.)
