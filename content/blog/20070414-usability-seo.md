# Usability & SEO

> Ultimately, usability is key to ensuring a good ranking. Concentrate on delivering good usability, employ some basic SEO tactics (such as placing keywords in the page title, headings and links) and the rest will follow naturally. Usability and SEO go hand in hand.

http://www.centernetworks.com/wikiasari-the-convergence-of-usability-and-seo Semantic web will mean that users define how searching operates. As the article points out, search engines have always tried to pre-empt what the user wants, and have long realised the importance of user opinions. So how user opinions be translated into a search algorithm. There has to be some voluntary proactiveness from the user, and that is what has happened. The increase in websites that use and promote inter-site interraction, and offered easier ways for the user to add and contribute, means the users demands and the search engine algorithms are becoming more synchronized. Search engines pick up on quality not as a standards enforcer, but as an efective means to pull out relevant sites in search results. 

>   * The number of inbound links a site has plays a major part in its search engine ranking. Every link to your site essentially represents a vote for your website - the more votes (especially from quality sites) the higher in the rankings your site will appear.
>   * All other things being equal, search engines rank sites with good spelling and grammar higher than those without. This holds true in the real world too - who wouldn't prefer a well written site!?
>   * Google has its free analytics package, which allows them to take an inside peek to see which sites have the most conversions. It could figure that sites with more conversions are effectively votes for that site by users and should be ranked higher.
>   * Bookmarking sites (e.g. Digg) are all about user powered content. The community votes for the best sites, with the best ones being promoted to the front page.

Design and code to standards, involving the user, being transparent about your intentions, and actively expanding your social and professional network are all basic methods of establishing a presence on the web.
