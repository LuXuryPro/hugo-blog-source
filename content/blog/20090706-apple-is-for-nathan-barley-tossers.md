# Such a nice name for a shallow company

Fabulous video clip from American tv show  [Dancing with the Stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars_\(U.S._season_8\)), commented on by excellent comedian [Orny Adams](http://www.brainnoise.com/). As if I need more proof that Apple, its founders and followers are up their own behinds.  Girls love Apple for style, men in the vain hope having beautiful technology will enable them to get in a girls pants and get some more stylish friends.  Please gather together in one big Apple love-in, and stop boring the rest of us on how great Macs are over PC's.  Look at this video - this is the man who helped you to become the style icons you believe you are. If you have:- 

  * More cash than sense
  * Little imagination
  * No fashionable friends
  * No sex (with either fashionable or unfashionable people)
  * Nothing to do with your free hand
  * Enjoy being ripped off
  * Delusion that somehow a MAC is less nerdy than a PC (just look at the people who use them for chrissakes!)

**Apple can help you! **

_Or at least help you live in a delusional world where you think Apple gets you a ticket to fashionable life, but really all you get is an overpriced MACHINE,  made in some exploited countries in Asia._** **

_MAC's are less cool than PC's, because __Apple-philes are vacant and boring - and has anyone else noticed that hardly any mac users can touch-type?_
