# Return to Tumblr

![](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/tumblr1-150x150.jpg)Following the sad demise of [Pownce](http://www.pownce.com) soon, I xml'd my bookmarks to Tumblr and rediscovered the real originator of [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging). One of its great strengths is easy integration into websites, and robust import tool.Â  Compliments though to Pownce for graceful exit, and useful data export generation options. I understand that these kind of ventures can be fragile, but too many of these type of services just disappear with no notice to user.
