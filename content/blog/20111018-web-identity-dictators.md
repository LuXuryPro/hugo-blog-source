# Web identity dictators

[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc[/youtube] Christopher Poole (founder of 4chan, the anonymous image board site) argues case against the current behaviour of Google and Facebook around web identity. I have never thought that the idea of one identity is practical OR safe. The only reason to do this is control - and as funky as those web corporations appear, they are corporations with billions of dollars at their disposal. There is disturbing move to dictate to users, and in a stealth manner. The personas of these companies (including Apple) belies what is at their core. A stakeholder driven monster of a corporation. Christopher puts it so well - we are being treated as simple people, and we are beign coerced follow what the "we know best" web corporations dictate. I was pleased to see that Twitter was given a positive spin - but with Apple embedding Twitter in their iOS5, are their days of freedom around web identity numbered?
