# QA for web 2.0

Recently I have been attempting to write a test strategy, for qualifying web sites and applications for web 2.0 compliance.Â This is tied in with my efforts to design a [new methodology for QA](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/in/?p=240).Â My first challenge was to discover what made a website compliant, which was not easy. As well as testing the basics of accessibility and user experience, other factors had to be considered - more intangible factors such as interaction level, engagement and satisfaction. Some test companies have done sterling work pushing QA forward (<http://www.xeodesign.com>), extending the boundaries of what comes under testing. When I removed my pre-conceptions, and previous experience, it was not as hard as I thought.Â Once removed traditional approaches, and focussed on the users, I suddenly realised where QA had gone awry the last few years - we forgot the damn user.Â We test for functionality, stability, performance, load, but does the user like the experience â€¦.. not in the requirements.Â I am hoping my soon-to-be-launched User Experience 2.0 will be a unique approach.Â The â€œ2.0â€³ tagline is pandering to the buzz, but in marketing a little cheesiness is always forgivable. The coverage of such a test approach focuses on web basics of functionality, accessibility and usability, as well as conformance to web 2.0 - sharing, collaboration and interaction.Â These can all come under the banner of social networking - useful in personal and business context, as more companies are integrating the blog-mentality into their corporate sites, and in so doing humanising their company. Though the more cynical among us may smell a marketing ploy, but does that matter?Â At least this marketing ploy has its heart on itâ€™s sleeve, albeit precariously.
