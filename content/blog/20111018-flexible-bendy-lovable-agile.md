# Flexible, bendy, lovable Agile

This was an older ad for Twix in the late 70's/early 80's who main selling point was that there are two bars in a Twix, whereas most have one. A lofty ad concept in those days obviously, as when watched in hindsight, I just think "So what?". Two doesn't necessarily mean more or better. Anyway, dropping the Twix ad nostalgia, this is weak lead to comment on the Scrummaster/Product Owner team - why have just a Project Manager role when you can have two roles to fill the dual task of maintaining development roadmap and stakeholder expectations. If you want to make it really confusing, throw a Project Manager into a Scrum project. I can assure you that Project Manager will be very confused - SCRUM doesn't account for a Project Manager, Agile only recognises the task "project manage" (not the role). ![Agile dancing](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/fixedbidagile11.jpg)I am not going to make a daft statement that Project Manager is defunct role, of course not. The reality is that Project Manager largely remains, as getting the good Scrummaster/Product Owner combinations is a lot more difficult than finding a decent Project Manager. The additional pressures will be on the Project Manager, as they will be doing the same traditional project manager role, but more of it, more frequently. They can't afford to miss a beat, as they don't have anyone else watching their back. Another confused person is usually the Product Manager - yes, he is part of the team, but selectively. There is always information that people would rather not let the business know amount. Every day is like a little soap opera on an Agile project. And as with most soap opera plots, they aren't worth knowing about. But even if a Product Owner doesn't understand the nature of a problem, they will still be concerned because it is a problem. This is where Scrummaster becomes the barrier - to protect the internal workings of "the team", and ensure the business is updated with relevancy, not daily tittle-tattle. Product Owners should not take offence to this. It is no slur on them, or attempts at subterfuge, its simply to allow development to get on with tasks with as few external distractions as possible. Relationships are not part of methodologies - I assume the authors knew that, and also assume you can work it out. There are no definitions on how a Scrummaster and Product Owner should interact, beyond general assertions about transparency. You take these guides then use your brain. An Agile Project Manager can manage can Agile project - and in corporations, I think they would find this route easier than forcing the dual-role approach to project management. The more important process you can change quicker and to more effect is development methodologies. And notice that is plural - there are no rules saying a company cannot use more than one. Though to hear some, you would think so. There are many methodologies that come under the Agile umbrella, as its core is iterative and incremental development (a concept that evolved throughout the 1960's onwards). Imperative - the team. They are core to the machine which spits out the end product. The team should be cross-functional (i.e. complementary skills), enthusiastic and understand concepts of OO and continuous integration. These skills are not a default for a developer. You may have a junior or trainee on board but I am not counting them. In fact, if there are out of college/uni from an computing course, they probably already know about the concepts. And testers! Where on earth in Agile does it state "testers optional". So many times I have come across projects where I am the first whiff of QA it has ever seen, beyond the developer unit testing hellhole - akin to throwing a puzzle on the floor and hoping it lands right. Testers are integral to development process - how many times have I asked the question "would you buy an untested product?". Of course not, so why skip on testing on a project, which produces a product, for a stakeholder who has released the purse strings to finance it. Agile projects without testers are not Agile - it can lead to development running riot. "When's a good time for stable demo?" Dream on. I hope I have made my position clear ;)
