# Semantic Web Testing

![exit](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/exit1.jpg)I have been struggling to define with clarity semantic web, and more importantly for me, semantic web testing. Forgetting the sales one-liners, it is simply testing on modern web technologies, verifying future-proof score and extensive user experience testing. The semantic web simply put is an evolvement of what we already see - social bookmarking/networking have the seeds of user profiling, a large part of semantic web assumptions. User profiling is a way for the user to let the www know information on your browsing history, your interest, your connections, etc. Now this has to be voluntary in ideal world - not for secrecy but there are many times when this data collection is not necessary and maybe not wanted. Assuming there is this freedom (despite many sites attempting to ignore this), then it is about information you pump in - after all for information to exist someone has to have created it. Websites can also adopt this principle at an application level - I use [APML](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/2008/01/03/apml-support-is-growing/) to generate a profile based on site tags and popularity. Let your site tell the www what is happenning on it, and then search engine logic will put your site to a wider set of users. It is in your interest to ensure you site is not a standalone entity, but dynamic changing content. This make the semantic testing remit a lot clearer, and I hope also to the clients!
