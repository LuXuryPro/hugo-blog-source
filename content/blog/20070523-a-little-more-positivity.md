# A little more positivity

Struggling to write more positive posts, but mind been distracted elsewhere.Â Consultant work has been dominating my life more than I want to, which has left me little time to explore what's out there.Â Â A little late, but discovering the joys of [facebook](http://www.facebook.com), a far superior myspace alternative.Â Â What I like about facebook is it has a better focus.Â I count myself as extremely web and technically savvy, but found myspace mostly annoying.Â I like the play the dumb user on the web, as that is how a site should operate - coaxing, nudging andÂ informing me -Â I dont want to think, I do that at work!Â I am losing track slightly of web 2.0, but it is my nature to think "yes, thats interesting, but what next??".Â Â Social bookmarking seemed to start it all (happy to be corrected on that), though of course youtube was largely responsible for a mass acceptance (also happy to be corrected on that :)).Â Â In my early exploratory exercises in the late 90's, using opens source LAMP applications, all these web 2.0Â web applications existed back then, but the general web community was still in a pretty "static" state.Â As I have said many times -Â hindsight is a wonderful thing, now all i need is to build that time machine.Â I have accepted at this moment in time, my time is not here yet.Â My early attempts at video streaming/sharing venture in 2004, fell short at last post of funding.Â I found the fascinating [trustedplaces](http://trustedplaces.com) postÂ [$1 Million in 83 days](http://trustedplaces.com/blog/2007/05/13/keeping-you-posted/), a summary of their hunt for funding for the web 2.0 venture.Â Â As well as inspiring I am sure to many, it alsoÂ made me realise my mistakes back then.Â Â Am I just waiting for my new idea, or just hesitant of sinking my time and passion into something else?Â Well, I have a baby daughter now, who I want to ultimately inspire, so I am sure the ideas are sitting in my head somewhere.Â
