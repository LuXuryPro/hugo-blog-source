# Polyglot programming

> polyglot programming isn’t something you should do lightly. If you’ve only got one or two files that would be better off as F# or Ruby or JavaScript, then it’s probably more efficient to port them to your language of choice than to deal with the integration and deployment issues. But it’s nothing to be afraid of, either. [Polyglot programming – some lessons learned](http://www.mindscapehq.com/blog/index.php/2011/07/21/polyglot-programming-some-lessons-learned/)
