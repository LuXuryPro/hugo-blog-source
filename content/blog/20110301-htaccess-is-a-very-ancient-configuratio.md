# .htaccess is a very ancient configuratio...

> .htaccess is a very ancient configuration file that controls the Web Server running your website, and is one of the most powerful configuration files you will ever come across. Htaccess is sometimes called: "HyperText Access" because of its ability to control access of the WWW's HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) using Password Protection, 301 Redirects, and much much more. This is because this configuration file was coded in the earliest days of the web (HTTP), for one of the first Web Servers built for HTTP. Eventually these Web Servers (configured with htaccess) became known as the World Wide Web, and eventually grew into the Internet we know today. http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/htaccess.html#htaccess-code-examples
