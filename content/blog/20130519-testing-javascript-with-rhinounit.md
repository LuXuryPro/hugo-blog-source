# Testing Javascript with RhinoUnit

RhinoUnit is a Javascript testing framework for use within ANT. It has all the usual assertions, as well as new ones to ensure that functions are called, and checks to stop your code polluting the global namespace (don't forget your vars!) as well as integrated JSLint to keep your code look consistent (and pick up on some potential problems)
