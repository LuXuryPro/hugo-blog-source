# The No Manager

![Supersports](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/28711522.jpg)I often whinge about management or lack of.  I have growing realisation it is not so much about bad management, as no management.  For instance -I was moving in between Shoreditch and Brixton recently.  A good barometer of an area and the crowd it pleases, is the quality of local supermarkets.  In Shoreditch  they are poorly stocked and one Tesco Express constantly had broken doors on the fridges.  When I mentioned it politely to a till guy, he blamed customers for not closing the doors.  When I pointed out they are actually broken, he just shrugged.  No manager would accept that. Fast forward to Sainsburys Local in Brixton, where staff are attentive and polite.  OK the prices are still outrageous, but there were more deals, busy staff and felt managed.  So why?  Shoreditch is full of #nathanbarley wannabes and students, so alcohol and party is the focus, not reasonably priced supermarkets.  It would seem a sensible way to downsize sensibly without wholesale slashing of wages.  Most people I see in the local supermarkets in Shoreditch looks like the kinds of people that like Rustlers burgers, and similar beetle and insect filled food (and you are worried about horsemeat?). Having a go at one of the worst adopter of the "No Manager" policy, sports shops, feel like kicking a dead animal.  Chaos in a sports shop actually doesn't matter - it's not really a browsing place, just in and out as painlessly as possible.  Now as painful as downsizing it, that model sound pretty good model to follow in civil service or any company for that matter.  Self-organising teams are possible, though sometimes I think people mistake self-organising for leaving a team entirely unsupervised until a disaster happens. Monitoring and reviewing are still essential.
