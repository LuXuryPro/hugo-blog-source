# Throwing out more proverbial babies

I knew it wouldn't be long before Scrum came under scrutiny , and hence, in the firing line.  Scrum is far from perfect, but provided some kind of transition form palatable to both business and development. Scrum has had it's day, but it's very important to have a relevant successor (again, palatable to both business and development).  Kanban is a woinderful adaptive successor, but requires even more skills to manage effectively.  And by that, I mean manage business/client expectations - never ignore the bill-payer! It's all well and good to criticise approaches, but ultimately the project management side has to report to business and client.   Don't get me wrong, Lean is the right way to go in development, but how are we going to translate that into a form palatable enough for the people who pay project bills? It was difficult enough getting business to get their heads round Agile concepts, beyond the sales pitch! When people are paying for something, they want fixed dates for deliveries - wouldn't we all? Most Scrum alternatives do not appear to account for that fact, which Scrum does.  It's short iteration path meant business could latch onto these, as the closest thing to traditional milestones.  So we come round the loop again - evolution of development is far easier to change and manage, than evolution of business.  While we all continue to ignore the business side of delivery of IT projects, we will go round in same unhealthy circles.
