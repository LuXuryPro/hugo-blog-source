# Should you trust any testing company with "test" in their company name?

I have to say a no - why? The mere fact that someone decides to put "test" or "testing" in their company name just rings alarm bells to me. Putting asides agencies that rebranded themselves as test consultancies, there is also a ramp of companies in general, purporting to provide testing services. Each claim to be a leader in their fields (usually every type of testing you can name), and very few actually provide a service, simply bodies - testers, maybe test manager, but largely people who test.  Well, that's just what you needed ... isn't it? A consultancy coming in and behaving like an agency - a few thousand to tell you why it's all so wrong, slating your existing resources and processes. Then comes the stream of testers (they hope). Ready primed and doctored to appear like they really do belong to the consultancy, even though in reality they were sourced from jobserve, or even worse, gumtree (ISEB tester-pretenders get through the back door many different ways). Watch as your brand new test manager hunts google for examples of release cycles, test strategies - you are paying for that by the way. Watch as they slate everything by default - without problems, there is no revenue. Not every testing consultancy is like this, but don't waste your time - get in a QA expert, who can provide you with much-needed direction. Then you can make your own informed decision regards resources.
