<!--One of the most annoying but comical mobile phone users, are the ones in queues, and the types that usually do not look like dynamic go-getters thatn need to be on the phone 24/7.   One experience with an annoying chav girl in a supermarket (i.e  cheap, overweight, arrogant and loud), having 3 successive conversations in a hyperactive voice, at the same time telling all these people that she couldnt talk as she was in supermarket queue,  and she would call from home.  She would then look around at us in the queue with a "life never stops" look, and expectantly waiting for us to comment.-->

# Chav on the go

[caption id="attachment_2619" align="alignright" width="150" caption="Image taken from http://www.charvas.co.uk"]![chavette_1](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/chavette_1-150x150.jpg)[/caption] One of the most annoying but comical mobile phone users, are the ones in queues, and the types that usually do not look like dynamic go-getters thatn need to be on the phone 24/7.   One experience with an annoying chav girl in a supermarket (i.e  cheap, overweight, arrogant and loud), having 3 successive conversations in a hyperactive voice, at the same time telling all these people that she couldnt talk as she was in supermarket queue,  and she would call from home.  She would then look around at us in the queue with a "life never stops" look, and expectantly waiting for us to comment. After the third call, I suggested maybe she could have saved her self the stress, and called these people from home, she looked agitated, the chav brain going into metldown over a conundrum - how do I stop looking like a fool?  She resigned herself to giving me a dirty look that made her face look like a bulldog.  I cant be bothered to engage with these type of people anyway - stop pulling us into your squalid little lives!   Chav Nathan Barleys - the rise of the idots seems unstoppable. 

> Chav (pronounced /Tch'ave/) is a derogatory term applied to certain young people in the United Kingdom. The stereotypical "chav" is an aggressive teenager or young adult, who is usually particullary agressive. And who often engages in anti-social behaviour,[1] such as street drinking, drug abuse and rowdy behaviour. They are often assumed to be unemployed or in a low paid job.
