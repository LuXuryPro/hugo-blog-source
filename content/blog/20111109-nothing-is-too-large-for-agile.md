# Nothing is too large for Agile

Largely the opinion of Agile is that it is only appropriate for smaller projects - this is misleading. Large projects are commonly a collection of smaller projects working towards common goal. So the challenge is to use Agile in a more distributed environment. Individual projects can adopt different development methodologies, but the project management layer should be in sync. One of the founding principles of Agile is to share knowledge, and this is where Agile used on larger projects can fall over. It is not optional, it is imperative to share knowledge, skills and progress across the "sub projects".  Agile Business Framework (for PID, reporting, updates and exit criteria of large project as a whole) is essential for large projects, or it will introduce areas of uncertainty. Agile Project Management will be applied on individual sub-projects, with weekly catchup management reviews (including Product Owner and Scrummaster from each sub-project). Though differing approaches can be used, they should all adhere to the Agile Business Framework requirements. This provides the high level Agile approach for larger projects, and it is essential that ALL dependencies are identified, down to server architecture design. Historically server/network setups could be very standardised within a company, but now there are options that may better serve a project.
