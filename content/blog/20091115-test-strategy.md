# Test Strategy

_Designing & Implementing Strategic Test Approach_ We bring many years of experience in modern web development, and adept and introducing test processes in most constrictive of projects - integrate testing into your development approach and you will immediately see results across the board. A solid test approach provides a rock in a storm, and can identify weak areas in project management and development failures.  QA is term we prefer as modern testing should do more than test code, and QA describes the overall quality process end to end. Our semantic web focused test strategy and planning, covers usability, accessibility, perfomance, user experience, coding standards and design. We can identify a set of quick wins as well as mid and long-term test process enhancements. We know first-hand, that testing needs to adapt and evolve with a project, even at high-level strategy stage. The test strategy includes evaluation, and development of a pragmatic overall plan of action. We can also provide onsite resources for a full quality process, however, we are happy to pass on direction to your existing test team.
