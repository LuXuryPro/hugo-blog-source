# Exit Criteria

![blood](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/blood-150x112.jpg)As you will know, most methodology lifecycle models are based around a big circle, or many circles overlapping.   What most of us look for is the exit, the way out of the development/test cycle.  Some project suffer from a neverending dev/test cycle, directly as result of unclear or plain unspecified signoff criteria.   If there is no criteria with which to guage success, how would you ever know when it was ready to go-live?  The problem stems from weak programme management, as a project manager is still subject to stakeholders (be they internal or external).   It is then up to the team to either work under this setup, or voice concerns, or (the most ideal) suggest exit criteria.  It is a task that can suffer from scattergun reaction - "do I want to be responsible for this?".  But then you must ask the question - "do I want to work like this?" ... ![exit](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/exit.jpg)The worst scenario happens when there are several overlapping lifecycles, as the problem of missing/unclear exit criteria becomes more firmly embedded.   In this environment, identifying inter-dependecnies is key to developing good exit criteria.   No point in signing off website registration prcoess, if the external registrations system API is still be fully developed and tested.
