# Open Source CMS Award

![](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/all/themes/subpixture/logo.png)  


Well done WP, very well deserved, and hopefully this means the image of Wordpress just being for bloggers will change.Â  I have used many Open Source CMS's - Drupal, Nuke, Joomla, etc ... but none has inspired me codewise and creatively as Wordpress has. Big hugs and kisses :)
