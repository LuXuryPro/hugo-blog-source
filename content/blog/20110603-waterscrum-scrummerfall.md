# Waterscrum & Scrummerfall

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/agile-manifesto1-125x125.gif)These two terms have been around a few years - largely to describe what was happenning within companies trying (or struggling) to adopt Agile/SCRUM into their software development process. "Scrummerfall" was negative term conied by Brad Wilson in 2006, to describe when waterfall was embedded in SCRUM methodology. "[Scrummerfall] This often manifests in what I call the One-Two-One pattern: one week of design, two weeks of coding, one week of test and integration." Notice glaring omissions such a project plan, business acceptance? This is result of people clinging on to old ways of doing things, resisting change with no logic beyond not wanting change. Waterscrum is a more positive term, as it addresses what Agile/SCRUM nods to, but not fully integrated into the overall project management. Business Acceptance was part and parcel of Waterfall - the advantage of Waterfall was fixed periodic review points - gateways of approval that HAD to be performed. "[Waterscrum] refers to the notion of using Scrum as a process in an organization that uses waterfall-based checkpoints to manage risk." One of my main whinges about Agile, is largely down to assumption of engagement from business, which in reality is largely management adopting the buzzwords, then never turning up for Sprint meetings or "Show 'n Tell" sessions, then complaining a lot further down the line that they didnt get what they wanted. Now Waterfall wasn't perfect - it was a slow process in comparison, but the business objective benchmarks were very clear, as was testing remit. I wouldn't advocate Waterscrum as general method, but ideal maybe for larger companies/corporations who are inherently slow to change and adapt. And also a lot easier environments for projects to get lost with nobody noticing. The misconcpetion of Agile amongst the business is that adopting these methodoliges that have been sold hard, somehow means everything will be OK. It won't - the process of acceptance is the same, but in Agile/SCRUM it demands even MORE time from the business not less. Agile can be scary for some, as it forces you to admit you don't know everything. But every developer and tester knows that is the way to learn, improve and adapt. Unfortunately business has not moved as quickly with the times, in software development. The ability to provide the appearance of control is a fast track to upper management. How many times have you heard senior managers saying things like "It will be OK, they are working Agile now". Cue sighs of relief from a bunch of people who could not even list basic Agile principles. A lot of business is strategic subterfuge, and politics. But to do this in software is perilous, if what you actually want is software that works and does what either the business or the client wants. Software is tangible evidence of failure that business politics cannot brush over easily. It is easy to forget that the origins of Agile and SCRUM were not geared for large scale projects, or projects with overbearing business drivers. They originated from XP (Extreme Programming), which in turn evolved from open source development (small teams, working in intense fashion).
