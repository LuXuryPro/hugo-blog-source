# Less is More (Lean is Mean)

Lean is centered around preserving value with less work. Lean originated as a manufacturing & production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. This can easily been mirrored in the demands of modern web projects.  Lean software development is an Agile approach, but still in it's infancy and people's old perceptions of success and efficiency are challenged. Lean development doesn't care what methodology you have in place - it improves the process by applying sound new development principles to the inner-workings of the SDLC. The myriad of pointless Scrum vs Kanban posts highlights the misunderstanding, and also the desperate attempts by people to find the holy grail of software development - one methodology that can be followed like a script. They will be waiting a long time. Business has a long way to go in terms of assessing risk, and what they consider risky behaviour. Kanban has become a Lean ambassador, though the origins of Lean can be easily traced back to Extreme Programming techniques (favoured by early open source community). If you are going to "go lean" then you need to adopt certain practices that will help make it work, such as pair programming (minimizing human error, and providing environment for controlled creativity), and continuous build/integration/test. Agile methodologies are commonly applied without these elements, though they should be included by default in SDLC. Extreme Programming, as with any Agile methodology recommends end-of-day integration tests, i.e. continuous build, integration and test. One of the common errors is when fundamental Agile processes are not adhered to, as people easily slip back into old habits and only integrating new code close to end of Sprint. Within lean there is not a specific concept of a Sprint, but there is no reason why you cannot apply lean within Scrum project management setup. If Lean runs lean, then a Sprint should become a nonsense - business may have it's milestones, but these can still be observed within lean process. It's a matter of what the client wants to see, and by when. This is project management, and imperative not to muddy your Lean approach by letting business drivers affect development process. Its a one way ticket back to Waterfall. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lean.jpg) As the diagram above painly illustrates, there are no Sprints - at least not in development process. It is down to project management to organise requirements-based tasks in such a way that there can be business milestones of sorts. The important thing is not to let business interfere with the lean process, which is common error - to apply business thinking to development practice, above and beyond requirements. Until business fully adapts to Agile, let alone lean development, there should be an effective business->development "API" style operation. This is where the Scrummaster can really be effective. This could be seen as lacking in transparency, but it's not - it's a way of addressing the constrictions placed by traditional business milestone/checkpoint mentality, without compromising Agile principles.
