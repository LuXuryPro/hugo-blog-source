# Why Agile becomes [Fr]agile

Its a bad joke, that's been around for a few years - usually as comment on how Agile has failed, or is perceived to have failed, down to the methodology itself, rather than people/implementation. What really frustrates me around Agile is the misuse of roles, and and creative accounting around Agile process. If you approach a project simply with perception in mind, you are setting off on completely the wrong footing. From the outset, you are sticking a finger up to transparency and standards. Part of Product Owner and Scrummaster roles is that you are wearing the pants in the Agile project relationship. You take the rough with the smooth - which is usually around managing client expectations. If you focus on perception, who is keeping track of the Agile process and maintaining it? Developers? They will work what way they see fit, if no-one is actually driving their process. Product Owner + Scrummaster = Project Manager. Combine these roles, or omit one, and again you are starting your Agile project on wrong footing. It can work if the person in that combined role is very effective at Agile project management, but that's a big assumption. Waterscrum is the most common Agile fallback position, but even that will fail, if the development team are not working to an Agile development methodology. Scrum isn't enough if not applied all the way down, and surprisingly frequently, it isn't. Development needs to be managed effectively and good practices instilled in the team. QA sees these problems in a much clearer fashion, and we are directly impacted by them as they affect our testing schedule and sign-off processes from early stages. This is a main reason why testing is demoted on a Agile project to a functional non-speaking role. This is to allow Agile projects to operate in many different ways, which sometimes contradict general QA principles on delivery. What QA isn't interested in is perception games.
