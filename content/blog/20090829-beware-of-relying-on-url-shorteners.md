# Beware of relying on URL shorteners

> ![shorturlservices](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/08/shorturlservices-150x112.jpg)The worst problem is that shortening services add another layer of indirection to an already creaky system. A regular hyperlink implicates a browser, its DNS resolver, the publisher's DNS server, and the publisher's website. With a shortening service, you're adding something that acts like a third DNS resolver, except one that is assembled out of unvetted PHP and MySQL, without the benevolent oversight of luminaries like Dan Kaminsky and St. Postel.

It is a good point - and my major concern is what happens if/when these services fold?   Though I do steer clear of URL shorteners, I use them frequently in Twitter, due to 140 char restriction.. Important links can be lost if kept using a url shortener service.  Has anyone had bad experience of this?  I think web services sohould follow lead of sites sites as Delicious, who provide their own url shortening service.

URL shorteners make it way easier to [rickroll](http://bit.ly/1628nB)—I mean, _[rickroll_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickroll)—your friends. The deeper meaning of rickrolling, such as it is, is that neither the clicking human nor the spidering robot knows what to expect on the other side of the link.

[Tinyurl](http://www.tinyurl.com) and others addressed the potential weak spot where clickers do not know destination the are clicking to, but adding a preview function.  This invariably lengthens URL, and not foolproof (homepages are not always indicative of site content). I think it is simply time for services like this to evolve (integrating their technology into other web services).
