# What is Testing

### What is Testing?

Testing is the process of identifying defects, where a defect is any variance between actual and expected results. Testing is an effective approach to producing a high quality product. One aspect is the process of objectively reviewing project deliverables and the processes that produce them (including testing), to identify defects, and then making recommendations for improvement based on the reviews. Testing cannot establish that a product functions properly under all conditions – that is not humanly possible - but it can establish that it does not function properly under specific conditions.

### Does it do what it is supposed to do and do what it needs to do?

Testing is about measuring how far the end user requirements are matched by software delivered, and on a more general level, is the software generally fit for purpose. Web testing introduces other generic test areas, such as usability, web accessibility and site logic. This does not need to be specified – websites should adhere to adopting the principles, and these guidelines are covered extensively by the [w3c](http://www.w3.org/). 

### Types of Testing

There are many types of testing, but the most common in web application development is Agile. Agile methods allow the development team to get rapid relevant feedback regarding the software being built, by close working relationship with testers and business decision makers. But it does require dedicated professional testers, as the release schedule is more rapid (done in short iterations), and requires testers to work closely with developers. Most agile practices are valuable because they create feedback loops that allow teams to adapt rapidly to changing demands. 

### Common Agile Testing Errors

A lot of companies adopt Agile with a grab-bag approach without quite realizing the point of the practices. Dedicated test resources are essential to maintain sound Agile practices and engagement from the business is necessary to ensure development adaptability does not stop beyond the testing/development cycle.
