# Worlds collide

We all have lives outside work, and sensibly keep a gap between the two. This is healthy balance but difficult maintain on consistent basis. I will freely admit there has been a freewheeling chaos in my personal life for 6 years, and maintaining professional life is those circumstances is harder. But entirely possible to do this in the "Worlds collide" syndrome. But if your outside life starts to get out of control, it can punch a hole in your career, or even your health. And if your worklife get too out of control, your relationships will be a target.

> If your personal life is in chaos, you will not succeed professionally

There always seems to be a chaotic element to my life, that doesn't cross into my professional life. I enjoy the switchover to professional mode, but wasn't always so smart. It is not a matter of appearing mysterious or aloof, it's a matter of being in a job, a role - this is the period of time when someone is paying for your skills. That should drive your outward persona at work, not personal details. You will naturally form relationships in the work environment, so there's the room to let more personal sharing happen naturally. Bringing your personal life into work is fatal. Though people are sympathetic to personal situations, it will not do you any favours when it comes to promotion, or in my case, contract entensions. This is actually easy to do - that is, until something akin to the weight of a planet lands on your life. Even with personal dramas in your life, there is a satisfaction in keeping your personal and professional lives apart. Create the immovable wall between them, that deserves to be there. There is truth in the above quote; but as with anything in life, disaster doesn't have to be a certainty, it's all about the path(s) you take.
