# ASP.NET MVC Best Practices

What is ASP.NET MVC? The **model **contains the core information for an application. This includes the data and validation rules as well as data access and aggregation logic. The **view **encapsulates the presentation of the application, and in ASP.NET this is typically the HTML markup. Â The **controller **contains the control-flow logic. It interacts with the Model and Views to control the flow of information and execution of the application.
