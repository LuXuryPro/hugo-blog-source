# When drowning in buzzwords ...

... its a good idea to go back to fundamentals http://www.slideshare.net/guestc6fddd0/kano-analysis-3207951   


> Kano analysis was created by Professor Noriaki Kano in the 1980s and is used to optimise a product by categorising its features by perceived customer value. In a simplified form, a product's features can be split into three types: Essentials - those product features are essential for the customer to even consider buying it. Linears - those product features that are linearly valuable, ie those where doubling an element of the feature is perceived as being twice as desirable. Delighters - those product features that delight a customer - usually only a small number being necessary. [Agile Business Change Blog](http://www.bcs.org/content/conBlogPost/1195)
