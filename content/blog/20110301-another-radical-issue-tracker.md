# Another "radical" issue tracker

http://www.bugherd.com/welcome Less of a recommendation, more of a why??? First bad impression was that the link sent in (unsolicited) email was broken, as they didnt take the time to test their email (derr!). This is a complete mis-sell, and companies should be wary as it has use maybe at a pure design agency, but for an IT project ... I think not. An issue trackers by designers for designers - what a complete waste of time and shows the ignorance that comes forth when desginers attempt to dictate project methodology. If a company invest time and money into an issue tracking system, then the people they are paying wages to should damn well use it. The sales line is pretty unimpressive - boasting speed (I doubt it with the heavy AJAX usage), website embedding (poor lickle designers struggle with more than one window open at a time), and bizarrely insinuate they are offering a radical new search with tags(ooooh, that hasn't been done before). Any issue tracking system can be customised for clients, and very configurable. I dont know where their points of reference are (no comparisons here). I hate to break it to them, but web projects are technically driven, not by design. The web projects that get it the other way round are clunky, costly, and mask potential issues that can bring down sites. If you buy this, then you are a mug who employs people who are bossing you around. This product is offering nothing new, just pandering to web project members who consider themselves above the project lifecycle. Being a designer is one thing - being a project team player is another thing entirely. If Bugherd is suggesting that designer use a different issue tracker, that is complete nonsense, and belies an ignorance to the overall process on a IT project. "I don't know how we ever lived without this." says Michael Dwyer @ changefactory.com.au - I think you would have survived!
