# Flash by name ...

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/02/flashrunner-170x170.png)Who are the most insecure developers from a QA point of view? Flash developers without a doubt. This is mostly down to fact they know testers are disnterested with how pretty something looks - site style and look is important, but that is not an area of testing that raises many issues (mainly compromises to design or user flow requirements, if they exist on flash projects - they rarely do). Flash developers came primarily from design backgrounds, not programming and therein lies problem. The reaction of a flash developer to functional issues is stress and indignation - a very temperamental artist reaction in fact. Any website done in flash can be done with Java, or simply javascripts/jQuery. But that would require a programmer mindset. [Adobe Flex/Air](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) has generated a new breed of flash developer that has more code competence, but still the same paranoia exists. This is a new-ish area to formal QA, but it will be all the better for it. Once flash development world acknowledges it cant live in its own walled garden, flash based sites will generally improve. Presently, if I come across a pure flash based site, I immediately switch to HTML versions, and if not available I will move on to another site. It doesnt matter how good it looks, to me flash sites always have the code equivalent of a huge band-aid to hold the fucntionality together. And it doesnt have to be that way, as long as flash development is approached with proper project management and development principles. Code is still ultimately 1's and 0's - you can try and reinvent the software engineering rules, but ultimately it will bite you on your collective UI behinds.
