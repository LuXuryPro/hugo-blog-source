# Guiffy - Diff/Merge Tool

When testing Related Content functionality on a website, it can be a lengthy business.  Although you may be provided with exact algorithms and search weightings, sometimes it is just a simple matter of if it appears to be relevant, not just that it matches the system logic. What you should also arm yourself with is a good file compqarison tool, so you can extract and compare the content.  There are a lot of tools, but my personal preference is this one.  Simple, fast and accurate.
