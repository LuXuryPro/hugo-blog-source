#  ordering

Something I am bad at maintaining, but so simple to do it has to be done. Nothing more annoying in a form if the tab order is illogical. While designers usually remember to do this, what is often forgotten the the tabbing order for an entire page selectable elements. Just go to any website and press tab and see where it selects first. It should be home link, but rarely is. http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam73-0.htm
