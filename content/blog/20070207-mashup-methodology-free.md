# Mashup - methodology free?

The approach appears to be inspired by Agile methodology, in the rapid interative process. But the focus is on user interaction and contribution, syndication, and external system integration. Seems too new to assign a methodology tag to it, but it is definitely a valid and effective software development method.Ã‚ The question I am pondering is does it need a structured approach for QA, or is it by its very nature an "organic" process that QA must adapt per project?
