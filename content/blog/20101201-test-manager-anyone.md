# Test Manager ... anyone?

![agile test](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2010/12/agile.png)With the ascent of Agile/SCRUM, and its development/client focussed approach, QA made way for simply testers - testers who remit was solely driven by development. A double-edged sword. As project management and development has methodology, so does QA. The weak links in Agile pontetially are the SCRUMMASTER and Product Owner. Certain assumptions are made in Agile, and a key one oft forgotten is to place people with the right skills in the right role. This rarely happens. As Agile largely focusess on development cycles, managing business expectations can lead to dreaded scope creep, or a clunky process around new requirements and/or changes. QA can facilitate a smoother end to end process, by implementing a more auditable and comprehensive issue management system, and devising an associated workflow which tracks an issue from inception (be it bug, task, improvement or new features), though to testing and business signoff. Click on image to right to see this workflow in action. One of the major changes for testing is the testing outside of releases. In the bad old days, testers would plan and wait for releases, but more sensible approach is to treat the formal Sprint release as a testing mielstone to perofrm regression-style test. Then daily testing/signoff of issues in daily builds. The key to the success of this testing, and added value is that a seperate test environment is a must, not a luxury. QA Process will not work effectively otherwise. Having testers embedded in development team is all well and good, but THAT is the luxury item. The major mistake companies make when employing Agile/SCRUM methodology is illogically making assumption that following it to the letter resolves all issues. The tester is very clearly defined in that methodology, yet assumption is made that developers will do the testing. They do unit testing - but this is only part of the story. Unit testing is standard practice for developers, whatever the methodology.
