# Real Agile

The more posts I write, the more I think I am disappearing up my own backside - work is a big part of life, but to dissect it too much is akin is to pretty much remove the human side. Putting processes to follow is dull, but essential. But there is a more human side. Companies are just people, and projects are just groups of those people - it's a different approach at people level, as there is real skill is building the right team and maintaining the right environment. This can, in fact work wonders, all by itself. ![ROI](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/06/Roi.jpg) I particularly remember when I worked at BBC Technology (now definitely RIP) - a project that was struggling, but had a good reputation, a strong Product Manager, and a close team operating in daily SCRUMs, flexible working hours, and constant, and I mean CONSTANT communication with each other. It made a frustrating project an enjoyable challenge. A different approach to the same problems can work miracles. The sales team attended broadcast trade show worldwide with the product, and pushed it with enthusiasm and passion, backed by our lengthy efforts to get demo systems up and running for them. In the end, BBCT was sold to Siemens as part of BBC's cost-cutting drive, and the project dissipated into the ether, I have had similar experiences which illustrated he true end-to-end success will be mirrored in the success of building the team, that ultimately is driving project forward every single day.
