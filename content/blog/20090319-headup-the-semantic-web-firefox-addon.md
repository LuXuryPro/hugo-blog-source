# A Semantic Web Firefox addon

![headup_smiling](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/uploads/2009/03/headup_smiling-150x150.png)Headup presents you with textual and rich media content related to the objects and terms it identifies on the pages you browse. star What terms and objects does Headup identify? You can use Headup to identify people, companies, places, bands, movies, books and more. Headup not only identifies these objects but has a basic understanding of the relationships between them. For example Headup understands that a “person” can work for a “company”, a “band” can publish a “track” and a “city” contains “places of interest”.
