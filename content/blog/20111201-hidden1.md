# $HIDDEN1.*

This is a start to pepper my opinionated Agile rants with some useful test automation tips. Although used to other test tools, I am finding Visual Studio Team Test surprising, challenging ... and sometimes leaving me with feeling I want to rip it's head off. Here's the first anyway.  "HIDDEN:" dynamic parameters that may appear in your test (actually, more than likely as they denote system generated variables) will cause issue in automated test playback. To fix down, click on offending entries, and select "Unbind" from the Value dropdown. Authentication is a common area for this issue, for example, a single-signon process, such as SAML, will generate a "$HIDDEN1.SAMLResponse" in Form Post parameters
