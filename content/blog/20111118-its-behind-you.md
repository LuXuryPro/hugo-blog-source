# It's behind you

I try not to let anything get to me to much, but I am seeing a repeated pattern when I see managers attempting to deal with Agile process issues. And what is largely discussed and changed is ... surprise, project management. Project management side is not usually the issue, but easier for managers to discuss and debate on - but the real problem is likely to be right under your nose, and common area of failure. Why? Because development can still be a very hidden process, sometimes masked by double-talk and hyperbole.  The development process is often overlooked in Agile reviews, as there is an instant assumption something is wrong with business process. It isn't helped when no-one really understands Agile roles fully. Development process is not Agile by default - nor will it suddenly turn Agile because you decide to use Scrum from project management. Continuous build, integration and test - if development give excuses why it can't be done, ignore them - they don't want management to be dictating development process. But projects aren't playgrounds. In order to fulfil the iterative and incremental approach to development inherent in Agile methodologies, you cannot ignore the appropriateness and importance of continuous build, integration and test. Development environments are generally broken a lot of the time - they shouldn't be. Not if they are following a good Agile process. Adopting this appraoch means risk is minimised as new code and bugfixes are integrated and tested early. Weekly deployments? Is a Sprint a formal release? No, it isn't - it a division of work - a marker in the continuous development process. Within testing, you can negate these development process issues, by instigating an old fashioned test environment, but this is patching a problem. At any time anyone should be able to see working version of project - it goes against Agile principles not to be in such a position.
