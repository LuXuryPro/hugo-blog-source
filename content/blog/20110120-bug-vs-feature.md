# Bug vs Feature

![](http://globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/bug_vs_feature.gif) It is impossible for clients to work out all the features they need from an application prior to development. This is the strengths of Agile and the ongoing review process. Bugs come in all forms, and developers take great joy from rejecting bugs as "as specified" or simply "won't fix" due to development complications. This is not an approach to take overall - bugs can lead to very useful feature improvements, and the benefit is that your client will appreciate what they see as free consultancy. Rather than just stick your head in requirements sand, be Agile and always be ready to incorporate new ideas into the development stream.

> if you fix the bug (from the user's perspective), does it add a new feature (from your perspective)? If so, it's probably not a bug, but a bad feature. If, however, fixing the "bug" does not result in a new "feature," then it was probably something that needed to be fixed. http://matthom.com/archive/2010/05/19/features-vs-bugs

What this highlights is the need to move away from "bug" thinking, and replace word "issue" which is more encompassing of various scenarios where an issue can be a error in code, or a fucntional error derived from feature requested.
