# Agile Complacency

It appears that Agile methodology works well for development by default, but can create issues in other areas, notably support and data storage.Â As the benchmarks can be changed rapidly on an agile project, this information needs to be filtered down rapidly to prevent problems at product launch stage. One solution to alleviate this potential pitfall is to keep trainers, support and DBA's in the agile communication loop.Â In the end, its the people who have to work with the software ongoing that will experience the knock-on negative effects of Agile.Â Looking at Agile from higher level, it is easier to see where communication can break down, and where dangerous assumptions are made. This is not a negative view of Agile, but more of a note that evolvement of the methodology must continue, as well as education to broader scope of people.
