# I hate MAC users

> "PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers." [I hate MACs](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/feb/05/comment.media)

I hate MAC users, I dont hate MAC's.   MAC users rave on about their machines as if they accessorise their life - a true epitomy of Nathan Barley-ism.  MAC users rarely understand anything about technology, except for technology that comes in designer package.  For some reason, they also feel the need to re-iterate Apple's sales spiel on poor downtrodden PC users at any opportunity.   As Charlie Brooker very validly points out, PCs are a lot more flexible, with a lot more free software and an inexhaustible supply of games.    MACs are for "preening tossers" with more money than sense.  That quote says it all - PC users see computers as tools/machines,  for MAC users it is all about fashion.   The comments from MAC users on Charlie's (old, but still relevant) post just go on to prove Charlie's point.   Tossers indeed.  Truly representative of the "rise of the idiots".
