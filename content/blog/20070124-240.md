# New Methodology

After seeing post I raisedÂ related toÂ Agile and other related methodologies, and how QA can adapt and improve ([see post](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/in/?p=225)), a friend of mine raised a very valid suggestion - write a new methodology.Â In theÂ course of consulting QA management work, adaptation of traditional QAÂ processes has been essential, as well as being the unpopular guy who points out faults in a company's development methodology.Â Although I have the experience, creating a methodology is a challenge I am happy to take on.Â IÂ am not looking to reinvent the wheel, just for the sake of it.Â Â But my approach will attempt to include positive elements from existing methodologies combined with with my experience in the field.Â Media/Gaming/Mobile projects are ideal to base a new methodology around.
