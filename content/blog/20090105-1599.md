# User Stories

User Stories are a good way to quickly visualise and define user requirements. You must approach this in terms of role, rather than user level (as a user may or may not have multiple roles). 1\. As a **helpdesk administrator**, I want to be able to edit all **helpdesk users** personal details. 2\. As a **helpdesk administrator**, I want to be able to generate monthly performance reports for all **helpdesk users**. 3\. As a **helpdesk administrator**, I want to be able to add tickets for any **department**. 4\. Etc.... Below is short presentation on User Stories:
