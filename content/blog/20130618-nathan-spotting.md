# Nathan-spotting

Take a walk round Shoreditch and Old Street in the daytime, and see the increase in Nathan Barleys. Check out some of the impossibly fashionable cafe's and coffee shops and yawn, as you feel you are approaching death before being served. Watch in wonder at the grown men, scooting along pavement on bmx's, with their knees banging their elbows. And lots of pretty women walking along like someone has a camera on them. As this is the likely first area in UK to fully adopt Google Glass, probably good idea to practice not scratching your ass, picking your nose, or examining your tissue after you blown your nose. It's meant to be a tech hub, but looks to me like collection of the worst excesses of superficiality in tech at the moment. Reminds me very much of the first dotcom boom era, and not in a good way.
