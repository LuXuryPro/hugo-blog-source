# Classipress Child Theme

**UPDATE!(09/11/2011)** _Currently updating this child theme for classipress 3.1.5 compatibility. Numerous functional improvements around proximity searching, improved FB integration, autocompletion on City field, and georss feeds (great to quickly generate mashup maps). _ [DEMO](http://storeitlocal.com/)   _\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_ ![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/selfstoragesite-170x170.png)I recently completed a Classipress child theme, with extensive customisations. Built on Wordpress, Classipress Theme, Googlemaps, and Facebook/Twitter API, and custom proximity search. It is a fully featured classified-based Classipresss child theme, with numerous features including:- 

  * Compatible with Classipress 3.1+, including current 3.1.4 (updates continuously provided at no extra charge)
  * Customisable homepage
  * Search Results Page template (with result mashup map, with clickable markers)
  * Users can signup using their Facebook login (far better than the one with CP!)
  * CSS3 styled (less images required in design).
  * Uses Modernizer script, which allows for multiple browser compatibility with newer HTML5 and CSS3 features.
  * GeoRSS which means you can generate [global mashup maps on the fly!](http://storeitlocal.com/map-search-2-2/)
  * Addtional search result template
  * Customised improved form, with calendar selection.
  * Additional proximity search functionality, which you can choose to use instead of CP's own.
**Template works with both latest version of Classipress (v 3.1.4), and Wordpress3.1+).** Free upgrades to this theme with every new Classipress version. Would suit any classifieds site and is perfectly geared any type of classifieds site, where location/proximity are important factors. This system is easily customised (by either yourselves or us). And can be easily adapted for real estate, hotel, or holiday site. Check out the current demo at http://storeitlocal.com, as (in Wordpress-speak) a picture is worth a thousand words :) Out of the box price is $50 (no licence limitations). Customisations can be done, charged on per hour basis. [Contact for payment details and link](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/contact-us/)
