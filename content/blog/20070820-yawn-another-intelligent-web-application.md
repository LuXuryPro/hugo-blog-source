# Yawn! Another "intelligent" web application

Is anyone else sick of self-appointed web gurus dictating how we use the web?  In general, I dont want "intelligent" applications working out what would interest me based of profile information, or previously visited sites.  I dont want to be forced to provide accurate information, unless I choose to, or it's relevant.  Web technologists are suffering from the same delusion as techies time-immorial.Â Â Invent the technology first, based onÂ the rantings of a small group of like-minded individuals, then try and persuade the rest of the world that they are right, and the users are wrong.  A right royal "Stuff you".  The principle of the www is information sharing - web commerce is a side issue for most users, as is propping up a proliferation of weak web startups with the lifespan of a fruit-fly.  There are a few exceptions to this, sites/efforts which I blog about - something I CHOOSE to do.
