<!--All forms of testing covered, in methodology agnostic approach.-->

# Testing

Testing is a skilled activity, that should be performed by people with varied technical skills and understanding of the project processes.

I am very experienced in most types of testing within companies and projects with very varied experiences. Most consultancies will try and get you to treat different types of testing as individual testing projects, but that is a self-serving sales approach. For example a load test is a test compromising of many smaller tests, which could be derived from initial functional tests. Because as most clients have usually highlighted a testing requirement, down to a particular weakness (Usability or Web Accessibility, for example), I have created sections to cover all the testing services I can provide, and a brief outline. Contact me with your requirements - maybe you just need a day's help, or a more regular service. I won't be charging on x number of bugs found, or increase the stresses you are no doubt under, to be reading on here.
