# WP Theme Framework Demo

This is demonstrate why theme frameworks are the ideal way to approach WordPress theme development. All coloured areas are configurable, widgetized, and can be styled.  The white area is the page or post ( the section in left-centre of the page). When you look at a website in this light, all websites do not seem that different.  It's mostly content that defines a website.
