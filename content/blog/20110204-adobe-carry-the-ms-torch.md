# Adobe carry the MS torch

I have come to conclusion there is a curse surrounding project developed in Adobe Air/Flex. Developers in this area have usually come from Flash background, and no matter how expert they are, they struggle to resolve issues. Adobe has provided a very good platform to develop prototypes very quickly. This is part of the problem - they look too good too soon. Good for a company just concerned about revenue in the next quarter, as it is easier to sell. Bad news for the project team who will see a series of regressed issues that seem to pop out of nowhere. Largely Adobe Flex/Air is not a decision made by the technology department - it has been sold to someone higher up the chain. Adobe have done well in their market - holding companies to ransom with their proprietary technology. Emotions run high, as it does come in for a lot of slating. When defending Adobe Air/Flex development, I hear the same old "I can do more with less code" - when I would rather be hearing how efficient and future proof and robust the code is. If I didn't know better (and I do, as I have met good solid programmer types who work on these projects), Adobe attracts the lazier and less competent developers. Dev's have moved on from flash development to play with the big boys and make larger scale applications in their familiar territory. Its a false economy - java development is currently cheaper, and would provide a more stable and efficient application. Java developers are also inherently more "code-y" types of people. Whatever can be developed in Adobe, can be developed in Java - and much better.
