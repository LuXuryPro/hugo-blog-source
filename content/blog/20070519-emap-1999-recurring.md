# Web 1.999 ... recurring

After a raw few weeks helping Emap join the 21st century (albeit in a blind stumbling kind of way), I realised the biggest hurdle on any technology project is people.Â In QA, we are in unique position to view development projects from a distance, as there is no benefits to joining in the same headless-chicken circus that usually comes with a web 2.0 project.Â I use the term lightly, as although publishing industry seems aware of the new web phenomenas, they are equally unaware of what it should mean to them .... yet.Â I put a lot of effort into helping make a seemingly impossible project with seemingly impossible deadlines work.Â And that was down to the people there that inspired me to do so. Publishing has been last in the media chain to introduce newer technology and concepts into working practices. Although fully aware they need to evolve in order to survive long-term (aquisitions alone arent enough), they are also resistant to "outsiders" pointing out where thy are doing things wrong. I experienced the same levels of resistance working on broadcasting and gaming projects - with an attitude of "we've hired you, but why the f*ck do we need you?" Well, why the f*ck do I need them. For a QA Consutlant, I have followed a path of my choosing, as I determined early on that in order to keep up, without getting bored to tears on overpriced courses, I follow an in at the deep end philosophy. Consequently I have a ludicrous amount of knowledge, which I have only just learnt to filter. My specialism I though previously was on media/mobile/web, but really its about my ability to deal with chaos and to adapt processes to ensure quality in these environments, without hamepring the speed or creatvity that normally evolves from these environments. Publishing have got a long way to go, as they have a very large chip on their collective shoulders. As well as the frictions, there are some genuine benefits of QA with these people - they know what they want, sometimes impractical, but cannot fault them on honest opinions. For me, this is imperative if these creative and chaotic projects are to get to a final destination. Emap with flail and stumble over next few years, but they are going at least in the right direction. As well as adding another industry to my experience, they have also given me yet another knock on m assumptions - something I always value.
