# The illusion of the Scrum "safety net" with Kanban

It can take decades for methodologies to fully gain momentum and be understood. Agile was no different, as it's taken 10 years for people to realise Agile had been misunderstood dramatically. Read that again - "to realise Agile had been misunderstood ...". That means we haven't even reached point we have addressed the problems fully. But instead of recognising our own failures, there is now murmurs of other methodologies - that points to fact we haven't learn enough.  ![Optical Illusion](/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Optical-Illusion-300x295.jpg)Stare at the black dot - and after a while the shades of grey will disappear. Of course it hasn't disappeared, but it's the way our eyes work under intense focus. There is an analogy careering into view immediately and maybe clumsily! When we focus on what we think is a solution to overall problem, our minds also block out the surrounding influences. Every problem in development can have many shades of grey. Agile was latched onto like some miracle cure-all, when what it did was reinforce good software engineering principles, updated for modern demands. Do we need another decade of pain, before we start addressing core problems (such as lack of skills in development and management). Or too bitter a pill to swallow? Well, as your web project/business slides down the tube, you can at least say everyone kept their job (even if there weren't doing it). If you can't guess, I am calling for more ruthlessness - Agile isn't a soft fluffy toy, it's about business and delivering software in an efficient quality-controlled manner. Now that's is hardly anything new, but what needed to change was management of that transition. Over the years, as demands of business change, then development processes had to adapt with them. Now what's happened is essentially a game - where development try to keep the project management layer happy, while project management try and keep the client happy. This is all managed with combination of truth and subterfuge. You can have as much Agile as your company can take, but if it goes against company culture grain, you are actually making things worse not better. Simply changing surface perceptions, rather than improving inner-workings. Now to Kanban, and the disappointing statements being made. I have to admit, I resisted the Kanban concept as I couldn't see where an end point could be - what markers could there be for business acceptance. What I failed to see was that this was assuming something very big - that development is agile, and runs to continuous build/integration/test process. Kanban represented this is business context, in form of task boards (which people are already familiar with) and the concept of fluidity - the idea that priorities can change at any point, and that balancing developers sensibly was important. As someone who trumpets Agile, I found it surprisingly difficult to marry a development principle with business. Then I realised my resistance was not based on denial its a good idea, it is because I couldn't understand how business could cope with this, given their problems with integrating business in Agile process. Below is direct comparison between a kanban and scrum board. Kanban needs certain rules to enable it to be controllable. Setting limits such as limits to amount of work that should be in progress, or limits of work assigned to individual developers. As with any planning game, it will only work if you have rules. The first chronic misunderstanding of Kanban (and Agile, come to think of it) is that there are less rules. Wrong, there are more.  There are four core rules to create:- 

  1. Control of User Stories pace - essential to control the flow of new features or feature changes.  Use the pace dictated to, and by day-today experience to guage how fast changes should be introduced to Kanban process flow.  Very essential to have good planning skills in your Product Owner and Scrummaster (Yes, these roles still exist - no need to throw out baby with the Scrum bathwater).
  2. Identifying how many kanban (task) cards can exists in each of the development stages (In Progress/Done).  Control is essential and resist temptation to ramp up pace purely to please business/client.
  3. Limit of tasks per developer (you can guage that on individual developer skills).   A stressed developer will make mistakes and pressure can be counter-productive.  Work to maintain ongoing realistic pace.
  4. Limit of kanban cards allowed at system test phase, to ensure quality testing rather than rushed testing.

Kanban keeps to general principle of rapid development:- 

  * Every feature and bug is properly tested in a full system test environment (test framework essential here).
  * System under relatively good control since the system is not overloaded with too many new changes, before in the process pipeline are verified.
One of the reasons people moved away from Waterfall was in it's assumption that requirements are complete at time of development start. For web project certainly, this had to change as the concept of delivering requirements because a more staggered approach. Largely because it was seen a wasteful of development time to wait for complete requirements, when it was entirely practical to start developing on the platform at the very least. Content Management Systems are great examples, as although clients will have different requirements (both in terms of added features, as well as customized features), there are many inherently mandatory features that could be started without requirements. A good approach to solely using kanban is truly embracing Agile development process.  The business has deadlines and budgets, and it's down to them to work out what is deliverable, based on the (expert) opinions of management within the project team. As with anything Agile, there is assumption that everyone in their respective roles, knows what they are doing.
