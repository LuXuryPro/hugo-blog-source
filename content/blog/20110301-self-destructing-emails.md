# Self destructing emails

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/03/selfdestructingemail-440x229.png) I remember when this first appeared in 2001. There are a host of other tracking features with the service now, but the core self destruction email service that this started on is still of most interest. On a childish level, you can send insulting emails and set them to delete within certain timeframe after opening. Cue funny "I swear I saw it" type scenarios. A more serious use is to retract an email you didnt mean to send, or simply had an error/misinformation in it. This has free trial, but for completely free service try http://www.kicknotes.com/
