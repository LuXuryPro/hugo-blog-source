# You have 24 hours to .... 

#### ![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/24-hours-170x170.jpg).... to clean up a fucking mess.

Was put in mind of this by another scapegoat area, that of the employee-on-trial. A friend of mine worked as developer at a place of feng-shui hell, a bizarre shoe-horning of banking-style management into the more chilled world of creative. It put me in mind of some strict boarding school - or what i imagine it to be like. And even worse, the teachers think they're cool - euckkk! Every day was a judgement day, it could start good or bad, but at the end of the day, performance is judged by any means necessary. I know that some kinds of people thrive in that environment, whether having skills or not - its about playing someone's game the way they want it. I have been in the odd contract that seems to be little more requirement than being a piece of furniture, and following whatever baffling process is being followed. Having involved in contracting for 15 years, I have seen a lot of strange contract clauses (always read your contracts!). I always found the idea of no notice period bizarre - does that mean if a company wants to keep you for life they could do so? Of course not - ridiculously unenforceable. There is also the odd case of the 1 day notice period contracts, then the even odder one where it is 1 day for either side. There are 3 main reasons a company hires a contractor/consultant on basis of 1day notice either side. 1\. The most common - companies use agencies, but don't trust their competence in finding right person (even though they can't manage to find the right person either). 2\. Second most common - companies don't trust anyone they don't know by default 3\. To have a scapegoat - A bit harder to recognise, as we all question our competence at times, no matter how much experience we have. But there is always a reason for getting that "bad smell" feeling - whether by scratching at the surface to reveal fundamentals flaws, or just a feeling of doom looking at project timetable. Oh, there is a fourth just plain honest one, which is when they are open about a daily, or weekly requirement.
