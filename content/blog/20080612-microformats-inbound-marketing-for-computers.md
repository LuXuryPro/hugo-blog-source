# Microformats: Inbound Marketing

You are attending a trade show and you want to let people know, so they can sign up as well. All you have to do is go to the free hCalendar creator, put it your event information, and paste its HTML code into your web page. Soon, browsers will be able to add a customized "Add to calendar" link next to this entry. That is possible because the computer now understands the event information. More impressively, search engines that index this page will also be able to add an "Add to calendar" link right on the search results page Imagine your web page standing out of the crowd with some customized, personal links for the user.
