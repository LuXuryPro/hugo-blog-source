Usability is probably one of the most misunderstood and misused of the testing types - companies feel free to adopt as little or as much as they see fit. Web Accessibility is probably the second one - "no, just offering font size increase button does not make the site web Accessibility compliant". The above quote says it all - the reason so many websites fail, as they are built with arrogance. Back in the bad old web of the 90's, it was OK to dictate to your users - indeed when things went wrong on websites back then, the default reaction of the user was to blame themselves. Now the knowledge has grown - your average surfer knows websites are not perfect, and also know that if they are finding a website hard to navigate THEY CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. To me, that is a no-brainer, as I am exactly the same. Don't treat me like a fool, don't pointlessly show off multimedia on a site, when it is slowing the browser down to a halt, dont give me overly long pointless forms to fill in ..... etcetera **You need me more than I need you! **_(Every 21st century web user)_** **
