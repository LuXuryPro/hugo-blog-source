# PHP mobile apps for iOS and Android

_**PHP developers can now build mobile apps for iOS and Android — in PHP!**_ Zend have announced [the ability to create mobile apps directly within Zend Studio](http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/23/huge-news-php-developers-can-now-design-build-and-publish-mobile-apps-right-in-zend-studio/).  Video below demonstrating the creation of a cloud-enabled native mobile app in 10 minutes or less in Zend Studio.  There is an annoying old-style "yoof-tv" wobbly moving  camera style.  A camera pointed at the screen would have been sufficient, it doesn't need to be dramatised!
