# What did they mean?

![iknowwhatyoumean](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iknowwhatyoumean1.png) Let's take the user story from previous post, and start with the granularity (i.e. the scenario steps). While specifying steps is an even better guide for developers to follow in their implementation, it's important to remember anything we say can be misinterpreted! Â  [code]Feature: As a online shopper, I want to be able to add multiple items to my shopping cart, in order to progress through payment process quickly Scenario: Add single item to shopping cart Scenario: Add multiple items to shopping cart Scenario: Add multiple of same item to shopping cart Scenario: Remove items from shopping cart[/code]  The first scenario is basic check that I am able to add a product to my shopping cart, so will use that as first example of how to make the scenario into an automated acceptance test. [code]Scenario: Add single item to shopping cart # Let me know who you are Given I am logged in as an online shopper # Let me know where you are And I am on page for Product A # Let me know what you are doing When I click the add to basket button # Let me know what you are expecting Then I should see 1 x Product A in my shopping cart[/code] Resulting test code that makes your scenario executable. My assumption here is we are testing an AngularJS web application, so the natural test framework would be CucumberJS/Protractor. [code]this.Given(/^I am logged in as (.*)$/, function (userid, callback) { browser.get('http://myshop.com/login')).then(function () { getVariable.username.sendKeys('validshopper'); getVariable.password.sendKeys('Password1'); getVariable.login.click().then(function () { // Check that I can see the Logout link, to verify I am logged in expect(element(by.css('.logout-link')).isPresent()) .to.eventually.equal(true).notify(callback); }) }); }); this.Given(/^I am on page for (.*)$/, function (productName) { return browser.get('http://myshop.com/product/' + productName); }); this.Given(/^I click the (.*) (button|filter|radio|tab|checkbox|link)$/, function (buttonName, buttonType) { return getVariable[buttonName.replace(/\s+/g, '')].click(); }); this.Then(/^I should see (.*) x (.*) in in my shopping cart$/, function (quantity,productName, callback) { browser.driver.get('http://myshop.com/shopping-cart).then(function () { expect(element(by.cssContainingTest(productName)).by.css(.quantity).getText()) .to.eventually.equal(quantity).notify(callback); }); });[/code]
