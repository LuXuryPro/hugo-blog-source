# Wordpress theme frameworks

Hybrid theme framework is based on principle that the majority of web design is repetition. So a good appraoch is to abstract that common repetition and develop a core theme, to support child themes. These child themes require a lot less coding work, and the focus can truly be on the design itself. Parent themes provide additional functionality and design options, on top of the core theme.Hybrid theme framework is simple principle - most of a designers theme/template work is duplicated, and so it makes sense to abstract common elements into a core theme, then child themes can be developed in shorter space of time. This can be expanded on further by use of parent themes. These parent themes designed to be an extended base for child themes. ![hybridtheme](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hybridtheme1.jpg) Originally, I got lost down familiar path when originally developing wordpress sites, which was the temptingly and comparatively cheap off-the-shelf themes.  If you look on sites like themeforest.net, you will see hundreds of beautiful looking previews. There is a catch though, as theme designers are trying to capture a big market.  So there is extensive use of shortcodes, which enables any non-technical person to add features with no coding to pages and widgets.  The problems start when you want to change something, and then you can find yourself uncovering a can of worms.  And because so many use jQuery extensively it can cause a lot of problems for plugins you want to add.  This is why I switched to the sounder principle of sound generic frameworks to build from.
