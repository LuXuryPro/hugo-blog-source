# Kanban applied to Scrum (video)

Rather than thinking in terms of using Scrum with Kanban, it is better to use Kanban as sole approach. However, if you have a company culture that is still getting used to Scrum or another Agile approach, consider implementing Kanban to compliment, rather than replace.  As we know, business doesn't like too many surprises or radical change to process, unless there is good business justification. Although Scrum with Kanban is largely effort to introduce a more Lean approach, without upsetting the balance too much, we are stuck playing this game until the business world catch up.
