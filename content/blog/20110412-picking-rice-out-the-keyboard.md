# Picking rice out the keyboard

![Internet Cafe](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2011/04/intcaf.jpg)I am constantly being wrong - as I predicted the end of texting with advent of picture/video messaging (I can get swallowed up in hype sometimes), I also thought there would be demise of internet cafe's, with mobile companies offering "unlimited" (unlimited is alwasy in quote marks when it comes to web access!). But I find them handy sometimes - I have a nice Desire HD, but still prefer the comfort of browsing on a desktop PC, even when out and about. Mind you, you should check a little before committing - the state of some PC's in London internet cafe's are total health risk! The worst I saw was in a chinese takeaway, and the keyboard was so stained, I couldn't read half the keys. I have used a few and some are set up better than others. By default, cache should be cleared, but in many places it isnt. For example, the one I am in now, as soon as I kicked up browser and went to linkedin, the previous user was still logged in. And logged into Facebook, and hotmail and twitter and ... well, who knows what else. It was a reminder to me not to be sloppy - if another less scrupulous person had come on the PC before I did it could have caused that previous person a lot of embarassment! So be careful in future, Andrea :)
