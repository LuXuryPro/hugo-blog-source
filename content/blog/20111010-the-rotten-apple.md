# The rotten apple

The cult of Apple. This is not a slur on Mr Jobs, though he very much inspired the vision on which the marketing was based. Apple is portrayed as a club to belong to. Yes, they know they cost more, because they are made of better materials and designed with a fashion in mind. Before I go on, yes - better quality electronic goods cost more money. Add design the add a little bit more. This technology is for people who care a little too much about it. The machine itself is of little interest to me - it is everything about experience of technology beyond the hardware. I get something that looks half good and fast (no gamer fast). So its a simple equations. Apple products have better battery life - again it all adds to costs. Is the OS better than a PC? Well, it uses Linux kernel (which can be run on either hardware), so no a huge overriding plus. When push comes to shove, the beauty of the devices comes high. The way everything interconnects, as it damn well should do all coming from same company. They are not doing any revolutionary, other than in marketing. A multi-billions, worker explotation suspect, corporation, who have managed to illicit some kind of fake love in their hardware. It was funny for a while, but now a little disturbing. Microsoft played a more openly ruthless game in dominance, whereas Apple have done it through multi-million dollar marketing that ruthlessly targeted the vulnerable in society. The ones who believed hardware can changed their lives. The tributes to one of the big innovators were touching at first, but now getting nauseating. He was no messiah, no anger - he was a very smart imaginative businessman, with a lot of drive and vision. They are rare, but have existed, do exist, and will continue to exist. I have no conspiracy theories on where Apple was going with it's dominant grip on the fashionable hardware. But it does have a slight bad smell to it ...
