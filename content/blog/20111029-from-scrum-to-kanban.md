# From Scrum to Kanban

You can add more flexibility to Scrum Sprint planning process, but introducing a kanban appraoch to development. Many feel that Sprints are artificial points, and to a degree that is right. BUT business expects markers for review and reporting, so amore practical approach is to apply kanban within Scrum framework. More team availability required, and on-the-ball project management. But this style of development can bring out the creative best of development, as well as alleviating pressures sometimes created by regular Sprint planning approach.  Kanban is part of the Lean Agile Development methodologies, who guiding principle are:- 

  * Eliminate waste
  * Amplify learning
  * Decide as late as possible
  * Deliver as fast as possible
  * Empower the team
  * Build integrity in
  * See the whole
