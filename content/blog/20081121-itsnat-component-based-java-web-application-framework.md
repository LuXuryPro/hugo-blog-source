# ItsNat: Component based Java Web Application Framework

![](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2008/11/itsnat.jpg) ItsNat is a Java AJAX web framework with **functional web test built-in**. Simulates a Universal Java W3C Browser in the server, the client DOM tree is basically a clone of the server and is updated automatically when the server changes usually as the response of an AJAX event. The server can fire W3C DOM events and send them to the browser simulating user actions. These are received again by the server as in a normal AJAX app. As the test code is in the server too, can check the expected GUI changes (checking the server DOM tree) or the expected business behavior (added/removed/updated data).
