# Boycott Trend Micro

> Barracuda Networks uses ClamAV anti virus software in their solutions. Anti virus developer Trend Micro accused Barracuda Networks of patent infringement with a bogus patent (as all software patents are). What Trend Micro really does is abusing the patent system and aggressively attacking ClamAV users and developers directly.
> 
> Whatever your views on software patents in general, or even the validity of this patent, suing customers is in singularly bad taste and can only damage the marketplace.
> 
> This is a dangerous act, and we call upon all software vendors and users to boycott Trend Micro and those who support them, to prevent this abusive behaviour becoming a BAD TREND which will be bad for software business worldwide.
> 
> Like SCO, Trend Micro has exceeded the boundary of decent and respectable commerce, it has become a pariah and should be punished.
