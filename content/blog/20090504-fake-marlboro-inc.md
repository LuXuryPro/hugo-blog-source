# Fake Marlboro Inc.

OK, so smoking is a disgusting habit, especially for some who habitually runs, but this seemed significant for the times.   A fake pack of cigarettes - and I mean really fake, as they didnt even contain any fake cigarettes, in fact nothing but folded up empty envelopes.  I have long suspected that supermarkets have to passing on fake cigarettes, as without actually smoking the things, it is pretty impossible to tell a fake. But getting this fake pack of cigarettes was definitely not something I am used to. Firstly, probably worth defining a fake cigarette - one that does not contain the glorious combination of quality tobacco and over [4000 chemicals](http://healthliteracy.worlded.org/docs/tobacco/Unit4/1whats_in.html) to make it "smoke right". Fake cigarettes usually are obvious for the poor quality materials, and the cack inside which no doubt is a mixture of foliage/balsa wood that removes layers from the throat, and leaves an ugly sticky tar stain at the end of the filter. Bad enough. Whenever there is financial crisis, it is usually used as a poor excuse for companies to rip off consumers further. It is laughable though that the criminal world, also increase their criminality - does the credit crunch affect crime business in fake products? The demand is higher I would imagine, so the sweat shops were obviously having a hard time keeping up with demand for floor-sweepings cigarettes. I wonder if there is any lower in actually quality of fake cigarettes - real fake ones I mean :)
