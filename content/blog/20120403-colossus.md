# Colossus

> What we're missing now, on another level, is not just biology, but cosmology. People treat the digital universe as some sort of metaphor, just a cute word for all these products. The universe of Apple, the universe of Google, the universe of Facebook, that these collectively constitute the digital universe, and we can only see it in human terms and what does this do for us? [A Universe of Self-replicating Code](http://edge.org/conversation/a-universe-of-self-replicating-code)

How very true - human beings invented the digital universe, yet struggle to process it's fundamental concepts. It is very much part of the human condition that we humanise everything - from our pets, to our cars, to our computers. So are we missing the point? Well, largely we are - the digital world is firmly dominated by capitalist tools of subterfuge and money-making. One the the most common comparisons with computers, is our own brain. But our brains do not work on digital principles, and the evolution of computers was through desire perform computational tasks much faster and more accurately than our own brains could cope with. Right from the start, we were attempting to superseded our own brains. This led to the pervasive paranoia that computers are replacing people. Before I even start, I can see where our perceptions of technology go askew.

[Colussus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project), the computer built to break Nazi coded transmissions, had an estimated 5.8 MHz processor, and no RAM. And inspired a book and a film of the same name, about how such a computer could take over the world with sentient Artificial Intelligence. As soon as computers became more in public consciousness, the more fear it inspired (however improbable it was). And it's natural - our fear of the unknown, the perceptions of good and evil we will readily transpose onto anything. Even easier with something you don't understand. Science-fiction nightmares are based on our irrational fears of the unknown. This fear is compounded by the emotion-free way computer make decisions. As a ruler, a computer would be unintentionally ruthless. So, we imagine more than is actually there (and it's fun too). What is the web? It is not really much more than a very large bulletin board - nothing happens without our intervention or contribution. I use Pinterest, which I like - but what is it really doing? Collecting images from URLs I enter, or images I upload. Oh, and I can share them ... and that's it. Now replicate as many times as you can be bothered, on other sites. These sites may or may not have facility to hook into each other. For what purpose? well, as well as content you have added, those sites can now get content you have added on other sites. So you are now aggregated - all the information you have entered is now shared between different sites (and by default, people). Those people may or may not choose to communicate with you, based on your content. Can you see where this is going? Nowhere. Colossus-style nightmare, it isn't. A colossal administration nightmare, it is. It is worth remembering the web was around 17 years old before Facebook took off, and 10 years old before Google did. And computing networking in general is decades old. It is easy trap to see the web in terms of these websites and others, but the web ran on before these sites, and will be there after they are gone - and still evolving, including the infrastructure behind it. And far more exciting things are ahead, than 2-dimensional social networking sites - I hope! _(Normal "I love the web" mode resuming soon)_
