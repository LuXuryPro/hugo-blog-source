# OpenOfficeMouse

![oomouse81](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/11/oomouse81-92x150.png)Another pointless piece of equipment aimed at who exactly?  Apple users are lazy, I think we all know that - they will pay for a gizmo to operate another gizmo to operate another gizmo - as long as it looks funky.  But this is aimed at the PC-user market - and we are not so dumb as to chuck loads of money into our hardware - because we know it isnt worth that much. This offering misses the mark entirely.  There is benefit to a multi-button mouse - if you want to accelerate that twingy pain in your wrist, that grows worse every year.  I am just waiting in anticipation to get hold of a decent touchscreen pc - no keyboard/mouse. What amuses further is there is open source project to be created for this.  If this gets off the ground, I will be very suprised.  Why cant they have just focussed on it being a very customisable multi-button mouse, instead of naming it something naff like the "OpenOffice Mosue".  Well, I am sure Apple will take note, and bring out a mouse for every application.  They have taken something simple and made it overly complicated.
