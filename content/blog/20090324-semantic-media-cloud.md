# Semantic Media Cloud

![mediacloud](http://blog.jaffamonkey.com/files/2009/03/mediacloud.png)**Media Cloud** is a system that lets you see the flow of the media. The Internet is fundamentally altering the way that news is produced and distributed, but there are few **comprehensive approaches** to understanding the nature of these changes. Media Cloud automatically builds an **archive** of news stories and blog posts from the web, applies **language processing**, and gives you ways to **analyze and visualize** the data.
