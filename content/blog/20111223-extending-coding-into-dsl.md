# Extend coding into DSL

Another good pragmatic presentation on DSL (Doman-specific language), taking approach of extend existing programming languages and increasing readability.  Whilst the ideal of being able to create applications from language-driven requirements is a way off yet (especially generic solutions), it is very possible to start adopting a coding approach that can bridge that requirements to coding gap. As any developer will tell you, each developer has their own coding style, and there is no reason that coding cannot be done in more readable fashion. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dsl_example.png)
