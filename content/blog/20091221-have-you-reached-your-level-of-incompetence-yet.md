# Have you reached your level of incompetence yet?

A book that covers one of my pet hates with UK business - I dont know if this is global problem,  but it certianly applies to UK.  For every star in a company, there are a hundred who fall into category of waste-of -space.  We are going through an age of work-enlightenment, and sooner or later, businesses are going to have to address that (especially SME's).  When I look around a company I am consulting in,  I usually see droves of part-timers, who are paid full-time.  Who conduct their life business from the office, rarely update their skills, and whine at any change that may compromise their carefully constructed work day.   It is well overdue that an overhaul is made on company structure.  So much damage is done at all levels of the hierarchy, from the business-busting politics of senior management, to ineffectual working practices on the frontline. In the UK, management has been effectively wiped - we are left with a weird flattened hourglass business hierarchy.  Basically no-one is really in charge or accountable. Just a lot of management at senior level, and a lot of frontline "cannon fodder" - the big gap is day-to-day management, which is the hardest management work.  Given the inherent laziness endemic in UK, that is no surprise.    Can a company with 1000 employees justify even a quarter of their workforce's existence?  I doubt it.  When push comes to shove, companies look around at their employees to see how they can streamline.  the cold fact is that this could be done at any time.  A waste of space during bad times, is also a waste of space during good times.  You really want to pay for that person?
