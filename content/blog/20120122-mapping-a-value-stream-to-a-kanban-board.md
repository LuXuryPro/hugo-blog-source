# Mapping a Value Stream to a Kanban Board

> Value Stream Maps exist for two purposes: to help organizations identify and end wasteful activities. Finding problems and creating a more efficient process isn’t easy; even the best organization can be made more efficient and effective. But bringing about substantive organizational change that actually eliminates waste is a tall order. It’s comparatively easy to identify waste, but it’s another matter entirely to stop waste from happening in the first place. Value Stream Maps can both sharpen an organization’s skills in identifying waste and help drive needed change.” — from [How and why to create Value Stream Maps for software engineering projects](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/10/howandwhytocreatevaluestreammapsforswengineerprojects/index.html?ca=drs-) by IBM’s Ted Rivera.
