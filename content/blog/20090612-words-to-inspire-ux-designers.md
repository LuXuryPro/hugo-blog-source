# Words to inspire UX designers

![](http://www.inspireux.com/wp-content/balsamiq-inspireux.jpg)  


A great site I use but I get too bogged down in the business and technical sides of design.  However we like to portray the web, it is a succession of linked documents, and how they look is every bit as important as the functionality underneath.  Good design doesnt have to be a work of art, but it must be intuitive and guide/help the user.
