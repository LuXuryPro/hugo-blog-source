# By the balls

I sometimes think it is better to go with open source, than budget kick-start code, such as Classipress. With a key release being delayed 6 months, I feel in the same stranglehold as if I had gone with a regular software vendor product - what has happened is I have done coding work to get it to do what was promised, and now still not delivered (such as proximity search). I now face difficult upgrade work each time (to sweeten people they did series of 0.0.0 type releases, but largely bugfixes, and not critical ones). Now it seems all I am using Classipress code for is largely form and form custom field management. Watching the movement of appthemes, they have increased their product range rapidly, and instinctively I feel their classified product has been demoted. if I had the time again, I would have gone pure open source - it would have saved a lot of headaches. Including their rather pointless and plugin-compromising use of newer Wordpress 3 custom post-types - I am still not understanding how their implementation of that has improved anything.
