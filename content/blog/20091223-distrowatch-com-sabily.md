# DistroWatch.com: Sabily

![](http://distrowatch.com/images/icon-large/sabily.png)This is example why Linux blows Windows (and MAC OS) off the planet - the proliferation of distributions of linux is growing, not diminishing.  What Linux enable is users being able to take core code and build their own OS.  This particular one is aimed at Muslims - there are other aimed at schools, hackers ... this is a true OS, one that isnt so inflexible and doesnt dictate which version you have. The most friendly one is fedora - installs generally go like a dream, dealing with obscure hardware components with ease.  Linux has come a long way.  And after Vista fiasco, surely its time for you to consider an OS that doesnt let you down so often, and gives you what you need, rather than loads of pointless crap you dont.
