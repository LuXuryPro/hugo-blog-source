# MOSH by Nokia

After the innovative mobile venture [Betavine ](http://www.jaffamonkey.co.uk/in/?p=350)from Vodafone, Nokia are playing catchup with the same concept - [MOSH](http://mosh.nokia.com/).  Hoping this is not cheesy reference to mashup, but I must say that this is a far better usability experience Betavine.  The design is very clear and follows the "Don't make me think!" principles. Open source philosophy is in full flow on this site, as oppose to the still-corporate approach from [Vodafone](http://www.betavine.net).   MOSH has some interesting apps, including a DJ mixer for the N-series.  I can see myself as a regular visitor there I came across this site, via a social networking contact, [Jason Nunes ](http://www.jasonunes.com/)of Schematic, a seasoned user experience expert, and his work on this site demonstrates this.
