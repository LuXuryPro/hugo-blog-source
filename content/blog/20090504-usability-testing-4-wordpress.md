# Usability Testing 4 Wordpress

Wordpress is an good example of open source gone right. I have side-stepped numerous times to other comparable scaled CMS (Typepad, Drupal, Xoops, etc..) but always return to Wordpress. As well as wearing semantic web on their sleeve, there is a host of plugins to extend your website. Calling Wordpress a blog system is very underestimating its capability. And it is surprising how many web savvy people dont understand that a blog post, an article, and static web page are essentially the same thing, i.e. a template, i.e. data and design. 

> One of the reasons WordPress 2.7 was such a success is the amount of usability testing that took place during the development cycle.[Contributing to WordPress, Part III: Usability Testing](http://wordpress.org/development/2009/05/testing-opps/)

I have signed up to be a moderator, which means I will be hopefully coordinating a team of test particpators, towards usability testing goals. Â Please contact me if you are interested in being a participant, and the format will be of following scripted areas, and reporting in any medium you want, but would recommend just switching on your webcam, and record testing that way.
