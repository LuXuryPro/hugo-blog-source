Hello and welcome to my blog site.
I would like to encourage you to look around and explore it.

## About me
Hello, my name is Radek and I am from Poland. Currently I am studying Computer Science at Master's academic degree.
My main interests include programming in various languages and reverse
engineering. I use [<i class="fa fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i>
arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) at every day basis.
I have big experience working with various Linux distributions such as:

- debian
- ubuntu
- redhat
- arch

I created this blog to establish my Computer Science knowledge and share my
thoughts and experience. I hope it will be intresting for many people.
