# About me
Hello, my name is Radek and I live in
[Warsaw / Poland](https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Warsaw&params=52_14_N_21_1_E_region:PL_type:city).

My main interests are programming
in various languages and reverse engineering.
My favourite programming language is [Go](https://golang.org/).  I have
switched to it from Python. I use this two programming languages most often so
this blog will be dedicated to them.

I am also big fan of
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
I have created several server setups using docker compose tools.

I use [<i class="fa fa-linux" aria-hidden="true"></i>Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) at every day
basis, and I have big experience working as Linux administrator.

As my hobby, I sometimes reverse engineer software written in C, C++, and Java.
So in this blog I will show also how to rewrite compiled programs using Golang.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at Master’s academic degree.

Also I am an amateur astronomy hobbyist.
